Say we have to access user details from a response of a web api?\nYou can use a nested ternary operator ? ... : like this:-\nconst userName = response ? (response.data ? (response.data.user ? response.data.user.name : null) : null) : null; or you can have nullish check in if condition like this:-\nlet userName = null; if(response \u0026amp;\u0026amp; response.data \u0026amp;\u0026amp; response.data.user){ userName = response.data.user.name; } or even better can make it a single liner chained \u0026amp;\u0026amp; condition like this:-\nconst userName = response \u0026amp;\u0026amp; response.data \u0026amp;\u0026amp; response.data.user \u0026amp;\u0026amp; response.data.user.name; What is common in above code is that chaining can go really lengthy at times and becomes more difficult to format and read. This is where optional chaining ?. operator comes to the rescue which provides implicit nullish check and make our code even smaller and better.\nconst userName = response?.data?.user?.name; Isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nSyntax Optional chaining ?. operator is introduced in Javascript ES2020 which has following syntax:-\nobj.val?.prop returns obj.val.prop if val exists, otherwise undefined. obj.func?.(args) returns obj.func(args) if func exists, otherwise undefined. obj.arr?.[index] returns obj.array[index] if array exists, otherwise undefined. Using optional chaining ?. operator Let\u0026rsquo;s see usage of ?. operator with user object:-\nconst user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, age: 21, homeaddress: { country: \u0026#34;USA\u0026#34; }, hobbies: [{name: \u0026#34;Coding\u0026#34;}, {name: \u0026#34;Cooking\u0026#34;}], getFirstName: function(){ return this.name; } }  with Properties Access a property which exist returns value:-\nconsole.log(user.homeaddress.country); // prints \u0026#34;USA\u0026#34;; Access a property which doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist throws error:-\nconsole.log(user.officeaddress.country); // throws error \u0026#34;Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property \u0026#39;country\u0026#39; of undefined\u0026#34; Access a property with Optional chaining operator ?. which doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist returns undefined:-\nconsole.log(user.officeaddress?.country); // prints \u0026#34;undefined\u0026#34;  with Functions Call a function which exist returns value:-\nconsole.log(user.getFirstName()); // prints \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;; Call a function which doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist throws error:-\nconsole.log(user.getLastName()); // throws error \u0026#34;Uncaught TypeError: user.getLastName is not a function\u0026#34;; Call a function with Optional chaining operator ?. which doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist returns undefined:-\nconsole.log(user.getLastName?.()); // prints \u0026#34;undefined\u0026#34;  with Arrays Access existing index of an array returns value:-\nconsole.log(user.hobbies[0].name); // prints \u0026#34;Coding\u0026#34;; Access non-existing index of an array throws error:-\nconsole.log(user.hobbies[3].name); // throws error \u0026#34;Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property \u0026#39;name\u0026#39; of undefined\u0026#34; Access non-existing index of an array with Optional chaining operator ?. returns undefined:-\nconsole.log(user.hobbies[3]?.name); // prints \u0026#34;undefined\u0026#34;  Access an array which doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist throws error:-\nconsole.log(user.dislikes[0].name); // throws error \u0026#34;Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property \u0026#39;0\u0026#39; of undefined\u0026#34; Access an array with Optional chaining operator ?. which doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist returns undefined:-\nconsole.log(user.dislikes?.[0]?.name); // prints \u0026#34;undefined\u0026#34;  with Nullish Coalescing ?? Operator Now you know that optional chaining operator ?. returns undefined if object doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Sometime you want to return a value instead of undefined which is possible by using Nullish Coalescing ?? operator along with optional chaining ?. operator.\nWithout Nullish Coalescing ?? Operator, returns undefined:-\nconst country = user.officeaddress?.country; console.log(country); // prints \u0026#34;undefined\u0026#34; With Nullish Coalescing ?? Operator, returns default value:-\nconst country = user.officeaddress?.country ?? \u0026#34;USA\u0026#34;; console.log(country); // prints \u0026#34;USA\u0026#34; ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/optional-chaining-operator-javascript/","tags":["Javascript Operator"],"title":"Optional Chaining ?. operator in JavaScript"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to loop through elements of an Array using different ways in JavaScript.\nfor loop The for is used to loop through an the index of an Array\nconst array = [\u0026#34;one\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;two\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;three\u0026#34;]; for(var i=0; i\u0026lt;array.length; i++){ console.log(i, array[i]); } Output 0 \u0026quot;one\u0026quot; 1 \u0026quot;two\u0026quot; 2 \u0026quot;three\u0026quot; for-in loop The for-in statement loops through the index of an Array.\nconst array = [\u0026#34;one\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;two\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;three\u0026#34;]; for (const index in array){ console.log(index, array[index]); } Output 0 \u0026quot;one\u0026quot; 1 \u0026quot;two\u0026quot; 2 \u0026quot;three\u0026quot; for-of loop The for-of statement loops through the values of an Array.\nconst array = [\u0026#34;one\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;two\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;three\u0026#34;]; for (const element of array){ console.log(element); } Output one two three Array.forEach() The Array.forEach() method takes a callback function to loop through an Array.

You must have come across @Override, @Deprecated, @SuppressWarnings, which are built-in annotations in Java.\nMost of the Java-based framework heavily use annotations. For instance, Spring Framework provides @Autowired, @Controller, @Component, \u0026hellip; . Similarly Hibernate Framework provides @Entity, @Table, @Column, \u0026hellip; . Annotations make these frameworks easier to use and at the same time make the source code more readable.\nWhat are Annotations? Annotations are used to add some marker or data at class, method, or field level. This data is used at compile-time or run-time to perform some actions.\nIt is important to note that Annotations doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any direct effect on the behavior of class, method, or field, where it is applied. For example, adding @Override, @Deprecated or @SuppressWarnings at method level doesn\u0026rsquo;t change the output of that method.\nHowever frameworks such as Spring and Hibernate use these annotations to perform some actions at runtime. For example, adding @Autowired at field level instruct the Spring framework to inject the dependency of this field at runtime.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s understand two important concepts of annotations now - Target and Retention Policy\nTarget Target defines where the annotation can be applied for example, at class, method or field level. This information is required while creating an annotation. There are the types of possible targets:-\n   @Target(ElementType.*) Annotation can be applied on \u0026hellip;     ElementType.TYPE class, interface or enum   ElementType.METHOD method   ElementType.FIELD field   ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR constructor   ElementType.PARAMETER parameter of a method or constructor   ElementType.PACKAGE package    Note that some annotation like @Override can be applied at method level only while others like @Deprecated, @SuppressWarnings can be applied at any level - class, method, or field.\nRetention Policy Retention policy defines the life-cycle of the annotation. This information is also required while creating an annotation. There are three types of retention policies:-\n   @Retention(RetentionPolicy.*) Description     RetentionPolicy.SOURCE Annotations are retained only in source code but ignored in .class file by the compiler   RetentionPolicy.CLASS Annotations are retained in .class file by the compiler but ignored by the JVM at run time. This is the default behavior   RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME Annotations are retained in .class file by the compiler and also retained by the JVM at run time, so they can be used by java reflection    Note that you normally use RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME while creating your own custom annotation because you may want to use the data from your annotation at runtime using java reflection. We will talk more about it later in the post while creating custom annotations.\nJava Built-in Annotations Now we understand that What is Target and Retention Policy, which are two required information to create any annotation, Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the java built-in annotations:-\n@Override @Target(ElementType.METHOD) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE) public @interface Override { } We see that @Override annotation can be applied at methods only (target) and part of the source code only (retention policy).\n@Override public String toString() { } When we use @Override annotation at method level, it informs the complier that this method is meant to override a method declared in a superclass. It assures that method is overridden with correct signature. If not so, complier throws compilation error.\n @Deprecated @Target(value={CONSTRUCTOR, FIELD, LOCAL_VARIABLE, METHOD, PACKAGE, PARAMETER, TYPE}) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface Deprecated { } We see that @Deprecated annotation can be applied anywhere such as class, field, method, constructor, package, or method arguments level. Also it is retained at runtime means information can be extracted from this annotation using java reflection at runtime.\n@Deprecated static void deprecatedMethod() { } } When we use @Deprecated annotation at method level, it informs the compiler that this method is deprecated and should no longer be used. The compiler generates a warning whenever a program uses this method.\n @SuppressWarnings @Target({TYPE, FIELD, METHOD, PARAMETER, CONSTRUCTOR, LOCAL_VARIABLE}) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE) public @interface SuppressWarnings { String[] value(); } We see that @SuppressWarnings annotation can be applied anywhere and retained in the source code only. We also see that this annotations takes comma separated String values. Few possible values are \u0026ldquo;rawtypes\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;unused\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;unchecked\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;deprecation\u0026rdquo;.\n@SuppressWarnings({ \u0026quot;rawtypes\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;unused\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;unchecked\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;deprecation\u0026quot; }) @SuppressWarnings(\u0026#34;deprecation\u0026#34;) void useDeprecatedMethod() { // suppress the deprecation warning while calling a deprecated method  objectOne.deprecatedMethod(); } @SuppressWarnings({ \u0026#34;rawtypes\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;unchecked\u0026#34; }) void useRawCollection() { // suppress the rawtypes warning when initialize non-parameterized (raw) ArrayList  // suppress the unchecked warning when adding an integer to raw ArrayList  ArrayList list=new ArrayList(); list.add(1); } When we use @SuppressWarnings annotation at method level, it informs the compiler to suppress the warnings which it would generate otherwise.\nHow to create Custom Annotation? Let\u0026rsquo;s create a custom Annotation @ClassInfo\n Annotations are created by using @interface, followed by annotation name which is ClassInfo in our case. An annotation class can have one or more elements. They look like methods. For example in the below code, we have six elements namely author, date, currentRevision, lastModified, lastModifiedBy, and reviewers. Default values to element can be assigned using default keyword  @Documented @Inherited @Target(ElementType.TYPE) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @interface ClassInfo { String author(); String date(); int currentRevision() default 1; String lastModified() default \u0026#34;N/A\u0026#34;; String lastModifiedBy() default \u0026#34;N/A\u0026#34;; // Note use of array \tString[] reviewers(); }  Meta-Annotations You see that we have applied few annotations to our custom annotation ClassInfo. These are called as meta-annotations, which provide additional information about our custom annotation. They are as follows:-\n @Documented indicates to include the @ClassInfo annotation in JavaDoc. By default annotations are not included in JavaDoc. @Inherited indicates to inherit the @ClassInfo annotation in subclasses. By default annotations are not inherited. @Target(ElementType.TYPE) indicates that @ClassInfo annotation can be apply at class level only @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) indicates that @ClassInfo annotation elements can be accessed during runtime using java reflection.  How to use Custom Annotation? Now we have created our custom annotation @ClassInfo, Let\u0026rsquo;s use it on the class\n@ClassInfo ( author = \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;, date = \u0026#34;3/17/2002\u0026#34;, // Note array notation  reviewers = {\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Cindy\u0026#34;} ) class MyClass { } Note that we have skipped currentRevision, lastModified, lastModifiedBy elements while using @ClassInfo annotation. Default values are assigned to these elements.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see how to get the information from our custom @ClassInfo annotation at runtime\npublic class AnnotationsTest { public static void main(String[] args) { printClassInfo(new MyClass()); } public static void printClassInfo(Object object) { Class\u0026lt;?\u0026gt; clazz = object.getClass(); if (clazz.isAnnotationPresent(ClassInfo.class)) { ClassInfo classInfo = clazz.getAnnotation(ClassInfo.class); System.out.println(\u0026#34;author: \u0026#34; + classInfo.author()); System.out.println(\u0026#34;date: \u0026#34; + classInfo.date()); System.out.println(\u0026#34;currentRevision: \u0026#34; + classInfo.currentRevision()); System.out.println(\u0026#34;lastModified: \u0026#34; + classInfo.lastModified()); System.out.println(\u0026#34;lastModifiedBy: \u0026#34; + classInfo.lastModifiedBy()); System.out.println(\u0026#34;reviewers: \u0026#34; + Arrays.toString(classInfo.reviewers())); } else { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Class Info is not available\u0026#34;); } } } Output author: John Doe date: 3/17/2002 currentRevision: 1 lastModified: N/A lastModifiedBy: N/A reviewers: [Alice, Bob, Cindy]  @Inherited class MyChildClass extends MyClass {} Remember, We applied @Inherited meta-annotation on our custom annotation class ClassInfo while creation. That means, @ClassInfo info applied at MyClass will be inherited by its child class MyChildClass as well resulting both produce same output when passed in printClassInfo method.\npublic static void main(String[] args) { printClassInfo(new MyClass()); printClassInfo(new MyChildClass()); // same output as: new MyClass() } Repeated Annotation Java 8 has introduced the Repeated annotation where same annotation can be used multiple times at class, method or field level. Before Java 8, this result into compilation error.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create @Author annotation which can be used repeatedly at class level. It requires two steps:-\n First create a repeatable annotation @Author. We need to apply @Repeatable meta-annotation on our custom annotation to use it multiple time. Note that we need to pass a container annotation class in @Repeatable. Second create a container annotation @Authors which holds all repeatable Author values. This container annotation must have an element named value() and of type array Author[]  @Repeatable(Authors.class) @interface Author { String name(); } @Target(ElementType.TYPE) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @interface Authors { Author[] value(); //must have this signature } Now we have created our repeatable @Author annotation. Let\u0026rsquo;s use it on MyClass multiple times and get the list of all the authors at runtime.\n@Author(name = \u0026#34;Author 1\u0026#34;) @Author(name = \u0026#34;Author 2\u0026#34;) @Author(name = \u0026#34;Author 3\u0026#34;) class MyClass { } Java 8 internally treats this Repeating Annotation as an instance of @Authors holding an array of @Author.\npublic class RepeatedAnnotationsTest { public static void main(String[] args) {\tSystem.out.println(getListOfAuthors(new MyClass())); } public static List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; getListOfAuthors(Object object) { Class\u0026lt;?\u0026gt; clazz = object.getClass(); if (clazz.isAnnotationPresent(ClassInfo.class)) { Author[] authors = clazz.getAnnotationsByType(Author.class); return Arrays.stream(authors).map(author -\u0026gt; author.name()).collect(Collectors.toList()); } else { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Authors not available\u0026#34;); } return null; } } Output [Author 1, Author 2, Author 3] Type Annotation Java 8 has introduced Type annotation by adding two new target types. Let\u0026rsquo;s use them to create @NotNull annotation.\n@Target({ElementType.TYPE_USE, ElementType.TYPE_PARAMETER}) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) public @interface NotNull { } The ElementType.TYPE_PARAMETER means the annotation can be applied on the declaration of a type variable (e.g., class MyClass {\u0026hellip;}).\nThe ElementType.TYPE_USE means the annotation can be applied on any use of a type (e.g., types appearing in declarations, generics, and type casts)\nLet\u0026rsquo;s use the @NotNull annotation on the type declaration of a field and use it to validate the null value. Throw exception if any field declared with @NotNull annotation contains null value.\nclass MyClass { private @NotNull String key; } public class TypeAnnotationsTest { public static void main(String[] args) throws IllegalArgumentException, IllegalAccessException { validateProperties(new MyClass()); // value of field key is null \t} public static void validateProperties(Object object) throws IllegalArgumentException, IllegalAccessException { Class\u0026lt;?\u0026gt; clazz = object.getClass(); Field[] fields = clazz.getDeclaredFields(); for(Field field: fields) { field.setAccessible(true); if(field.getAnnotatedType().isAnnotationPresent(NotNull.class)) { if(field.get(object) == null) { throw new NullPointerException(\u0026#34;@NotNull field \\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; + field.getName() + \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34; can not be null\u0026#34;); } } } } } Output Exception in thread \u0026quot;main\u0026quot; java.lang.NullPointerException: @NotNull field \u0026quot;key\u0026quot; can not be null at com.example.core.TypeAnnotationsTest.validateProperties(TypeAnnotationsTest.java:14) at com.example.core.TypeAnnotationsTest.main(TypeAnnotationsTest.java:4) Some of the example usage of type annotations are as follows:-\n// declaration @Encrypted String data; // generics List\u0026lt;@NonNull String\u0026gt; strings; // type cast String myString = (@NonNull String) myObject; // constructor new @Interned MyObject(); new @NonEmpty @Readonly List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;(myNonEmptyStringSet); // implements clause class UnmodifiableList\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; implements @Readonly List\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { ... } // throw exception declaration void monitorTemperature() throws @Critical TemperatureException { ... } Conclusion We see that Java Annotations are widely used by Java and its popular framework such as Spring and Hibernate. Most of the time, we as a developer are consumers of these annotations, rather than their creator. Though it is good to have knowledge of how custom annotations are created and used behind the scene.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/java/annotations-in-java/","tags":["Java Core"],"title":"All About Annotations in Java"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Elasticsearch (popularly known as ELK stack) is an open-source, distributed, and near real-time search engine, Which can be used to solve a variety of use-cases. Let\u0026rsquo;s understand the basic concepts of Elasticsearch in this post.\nWhat is Elasticsearch?  Elasticsearch is an open-source, distributed, and near real-time search engine. Elasticsearch is complimented by Logstash and Kibana to make it more powerful. This trio combination is known as ELK stack. Logstash are used to collect the data in realtime from .log or .txt files and store it in Elasticsearch. Kibana is used to explore, visualize and query data in realtime stored in Elasticsearch  Uses of Elasticsearch? Elasticsearch is most popularly used for following use cases:-\n E-commerce website like search box where you can search for products from a very large variety of product inventory. Google like search engine where you get search suggestions as you type ahead, fuzzy search i.e. \u0026ldquo;do you mean this?\u0026rdquo; when you type something wrong, and get the search result sorted by most relevant first. Relevancy logic can be customized based on the search term is appearing in title, description, keywords, or body content of the document. Centralized logging and monitoring system in Microservice-based applications. NoSQL, flexible-schema, JSON document based storage system.  How does Elasticsearch works?  Elasticsearch is built on top of Apache Lucene search engine Java Library. Elasticsearch is also written in Java so require Java environment to run it.  Let\u0026rsquo;s understand the key concepts of Elasticsearch:-\nDocument Document is basic unit of data in JSON format which are indexed in Elasticsearch. Document can have just a text (unstructured data) or collection of key-value pairs (structured data). You can think of a document like a record or row in a relational database.\nField Each document is a collection of fields, which are key-value pairs. Field\u0026rsquo;s value can be of type text, numeric, date, or geo. You can think of a field like a column in a relational database.\nIndex An index is a collection of documents that have similar characteristics. An index is the highest level entity that you can query against in Elasticsearch. You can think of the index as being similar to a database in a relational database schema. Any documents in an index are typically logically related. In the context of an e-commerce website, for example, you can have an index for Customers, one for Products, one for Orders, and so on. An index is identified by a name that is used to refer to the index while performing indexing, search, update, and delete operations against the documents in it.\nInverted Index Elasticsearch uses an inverted index that supports very fast full-text searches. An inverted index is a data structure which stores a mapping of each unique word, to its appearance in document or a set of documents. It directs you from a word to document(s). An inverted index split the string in document to individual search term (i.e. word) and then map each search term to the document.\ndoc_id_1 = I love Vanilla Cake. Cake makes me happy. doc_id_2 = Both Chocolate and Vanilla Cake are available in our store. doc_id_3 = I bought Cookies for the party. Term Document Frequency ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Vanilla doc_id_1, doc_id_2 2 (1 in doc_id_1, 1 in doc_id_2) Cake doc_id_1, doc_id_2 3 (2 in doc_id_1, 1 in doc_id_2) Chocolate doc_id_2 1 (1 in doc_id_2) Cookies doc_id_3 1 (1 in doc_id_3) Cluster An Elasticsearch cluster is a group of one or more node instances that are connected together. The power of an Elasticsearch cluster lies in the distribution of data, searching, and indexing, across all the nodes in the cluster. You can think of a cluster as distributed relational database.\nNode A node is a single server that is a part of a cluster. A node stores data and participates in the cluster’s indexing and search capabilities.\nShard Elasticsearch provides the ability to subdivide the index into multiple pieces called shards. Shard allows an index to be distributed in a cluster. Each shard is in itself a fully-functional and independent Lucene “index” that can be hosted on any node within a cluster. By distributing the documents in an index across multiple shards, and distributing those shards across multiple nodes, Elasticsearch can ensure redundancy, which both protects against hardware failures and increases query capacity as nodes are added to a cluster.\nReplica Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards which are called “replica shards” or just “replicas”. Basically, a replica shard is a copy of a primary shard. Each document in an index belongs to one primary shard. Replicas provide redundant copies of your data to protect against hardware failure and increase capacity to serve read requests like searching or retrieving a document.\nAnalogy with Relational Database    Elasticsearch Relational Database     Cluster Database   Shard Shard   Index Table   Field Column   Document Row    How to search data from Elasticsearch?  Elasticsearch provides REST APIs to perform search queries which can be executed from command-line using Curl or through the Developer Console in Kibana. Elasticsearch also provides clients in many languages such as Java, JavaScript, Go, .NET, PHP, Perl, Python, and Ruby. Kibana can be used to search, explore and visualize data stored in Elasticsearch without much technical knowledge. Elasticsearch REST APIs provide JSON style comprehensive search capabilities using Query DSL.

Keep following this post for regular updates.\nWhat are ACID properties in a database? A transaction is a set of instruction(s) on database such as create, update, and delete.\nRelational database provides guarantee of data integrity of these transactions through ACID properties, which is an acronym for atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.\n  Atomicity - A transaction is an atomic unit; hence, all the instructions within a transaction will successfully execute, or none of them will execute. If any of the instructions fail, the entire transaction should abort and rollback.\n  Consistency - A database is initially in a consistent state, and it should remain consistent after every transaction, whether transaction execute successfully or fails.\n  Isolation - If the multiple transactions are running concurrently, they should not be affected by each other; i.e., the result should be the same as the result obtained if the transactions were running sequentially.\n  Durability - Changes that have been committed to the database should remain even in the case of software and hardware failure.\n  What is SQL? SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used for storing, reading, updating, and deleting data using simple code snippets, called queries, in an RDBMS (relational database management system).\nGiven below is an example. You first create a table, insert some data in it and then view all the data in that table.\n-- Creating a table in database  -- CREATE TABLE \u0026lt;Table name\u0026gt; CREATE TABLE Employee ( -- \u0026lt;Variable name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Variable type\u0026gt;\t ID int, Name varchar(255), Gender varchar(10), Age int ); -- Inserting INSERT INTO -- \u0026lt;Table name\u0026gt;  Employee -- \u0026lt;Variable names\u0026gt;  (ID, Name, Gender, Age) VALUES -- \u0026lt;Variable values\u0026gt;  (1, \u0026#39;Adam\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Male\u0026#39;, 22), (2, \u0026#39;Eva\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Female\u0026#39;, 28), (3, \u0026#39;Joy\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Male\u0026#39;, 10); -- Selecting everything we stored in the table to view SELECT * FROM Employee; What are different type of SQL statements?   Data Definition Language (DDL) commands are used to define the structure that holds the data. These commands are auto-committed i.e. changes done by the DDL commands on the database are saved permanently e.g. CREATE, ALTER, TRUNCATE, DROP, RENAME, COMMENT\n  Data Query Language (DQL) commands are used to perform queries to on the data e.g. SELECT\n  Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands are used to manipulate the data of the database. These commands are not auto-committed and can be rolled back e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE\n  Data Control Language (DCL) commands are used to deal with the rights, permission, and other controls of the database e.g. GRANT, REVOKE\n  Transaction Control Language (TCL) commands are used to deal with transactions within the database e.g. COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT\n  What are different types of clauses in SQL? SQL clauses are used to qualify a database query by restricting or altering the values that it returns. The types of SQL clauses are:\n  FROM: Used to specify which tables the data will be pulled from. For example, get all records from Employee table:-\nSELECT * FROM Employee;   WHERE: Used to filter the records by one or more conditions. For example, get all Female employee\u0026rsquo;s record over the age 18:-\nSELECT * FROM Employee WHERE Gender = \u0026#39;Female\u0026#39; and Age \u0026gt; 18;   ORDER BY: Used to sort the records returned by query. For example, get all the employee\u0026rsquo;s records sorted by Name in ascending order:-\nSELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY Name;   GROUP BY: Used to group the records together that have similar values. For example, get average salary of employees by department:-\nSELECT DepartmentId, AVG(Salary) FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentID;   HAVING: Used in combination with the GROUP BY clause. Used to filter the records from each group after groupings are made.\nSELECT DepartmentId, AVG(Salary) FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentID HAVING AVG(Salary) \u0026gt; 3000;   DISTINCT: Used to get distinct records from a table, duplicate records are removed. For example, you may wish to list the different gender in Employee\u0026rsquo;s table:-\nSELECT DISTINCT(Gender) FROM Employee;   What is the difference between the WHERE and HAVING clause? When GROUP BY is not used, the WHERE and HAVING clauses are essentially equivalent.\nHowever, when GROUP BY is used:\n The WHERE clause is used to filter records from all rows before groupings are made. The HAVING clause is used to filter records from each group of rows after groupings are made.  What are Aggregate Functions? An aggregate function is a function that\u0026rsquo;s applied on multiple values, and returns a single value after the calculation. In SQL, there are multiple aggregate functions. The most commonly used ones are:\n MIN() - to find the minium out of all values of a column MAX() - to find the maximum out of all values of a column SUM() - to find the sum of all values of a column AVG() - to find the average of all values of a column COUNT() - to find the count of all values of a column  SELECT MIN(Age), MAX(Age), SUM(Age), AVG(Age), COUNT(Age) FROM Employee; What are TRUNCATE, DELETE and DROP statements?  DELETE is DML statement used to delete specific rows from a table using WHERE clause. All the rows can also be deleted if WHERE clause is not used. It requires explicit commit to make its effect permanent. DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeId \u0026gt; 1000;  TRUNCATE is a DDL statement used to delete all the rows from the table. It does not require a commit to make the changes permanent and this is the reason why rows deleted by truncate could not be roll-backed. TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;  DROP command is used to delete the table structure including all the rows from the database. DROP TABLE Employees;   What are the different types of JOIN clauses in SQL? A JOIN clause combines records from multiple tables into a single table, based on the common values that they share between one or more columns.\nSuppose we have Employee and Department tables which share common department_id column.\nEmployee +----+---------+--------+--------+---------------+ | id | name | gender | salary | department_id | +----+---------+--------+--------+---------------+ | 1 | Adam | m | 2500 | 1 | | 2 | Becca | f | 1500 | 1 | | 3 | Charlie | m | 5500 | 2 | | 4 | Eva | f | 500 | NULL | +----+---------+--------+--------+---------------+ Department +---------------+---------+ | department_id | name | +---------------+---------+ | 1 | HR | | 2 | Dev | | 3 | IT | | 4 | QA | +---------------+---------+ The different types of JOIN clauses in SQL are:\n INNER JOIN (a.k.a. “Simple Join”) Returns all records that have at least one match in both tables. This is the default type of join if no specific JOIN type is specified. SELECT * FROM Employee e JOIN Department d ON e.department_id = d.department_id; -- OR SELECT * FROM Employee e, Department d WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id;  LEFT JOIN Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table; i.e., the results will contain all records from the left table, even if the JOIN condition doesn’t find any matching records in the right table. This means that if the ON clause doesn’t match any records in the right table, the JOIN will still return a row in the result for that record in the left table, but with NULL in each column from the right table. SELECT * FROM Employee e LEFT JOIN Department d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;  RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. This is the exact opposite of a LEFT JOIN; i.e., the results will contain all records from the right table, even if the JOIN condition doesn’t find any matching records in the left table. This means that if the ON clause doesn’t match any records in the left table, the JOIN will still return a row in the result for that record in the right table, but with NULL in each column from the left table. SELECT * FROM Employee e RIGHT JOIN Department d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;  FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows for which there is a match in EITHER of the tables. Conceptually, a FULL JOIN combines the effect of applying both a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN; i.e., its result set is equivalent to performing a UNION of the results of left and right outer queries. SELECT * FROM Employee e FULL JOIN Department d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;  CROSS JOIN Returns all records where each row from the first table is combined with each row from the second table (i.e., returns the Cartesian product of the sets of rows from the joined tables). Note that a CROSS JOIN can either be specified using the CROSS JOIN syntax (“explicit join notation”) or (b) listing the tables in the FROM clause separated by commas without using a WHERE clause to supply join criteria (“implicit join notation”). SELECT * FROM Employee e CROSS JOIN Department d ON e.department_id = d.department_id; -- OR SELECT * FROM Employee e, Department d;   What are Constraints? Constraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the table. It can be applied for single or multiple fields in an SQL table during creation of table or after creationg using the ALTER TABLE command. The constraints are:\n NOT NULL - Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column. CHECK - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition. DEFAULT - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field. UNIQUE - Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field. INDEX - Indexes a field providing faster retrieval of records. PRIMARY KEY - Uniquely identifies each record in a table. FOREIGN KEY - Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.  CREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 datatype constraint, column2 datatype constraint, column3 datatype constraint, .... ); CREATE TABLE Employee ( ID int NOT NULL UNIQUE, LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL, FirstName varchar(255), Age int CHECK (Age\u0026gt;=18), City varchar(255) DEFAULT \u0026#39;NA\u0026#39;, ); What is a NOT NULL constraint? The NOT NULL constraint ensures that all values in a column must always contains a value, and not contains NULL. This provides guarantee that record cannot be inserted or updated with NULL value for that column.\n/* Create table with NOT NULL constraint on ID, LastName and FirstName column */ CREATE TABLE Employee ( ID int NOT NULL, LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL, FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL, Age int ); /* Add NOT NULL constraint on Age column */ ALTER TABLE Employee MODIFY Age int NOT NULL; What is a UNIQUE constraint? A UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different. This provides a guarantee of uniqueness for the column(s) and helps identify each row uniquely. There can be multiple unique constraints defined per table.\n/* Create table with UNIQUE constraint on ID column */ CREATE TABLE Employee ( ID int NOT NULL, LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL, FirstName varchar(255), Age int, UNIQUE (ID) ); /* Create table with UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns */ CREATE TABLE Employee ( ID int NOT NULL, LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL, FirstName varchar(255), Age int, CONSTRAINT UC_Employee UNIQUE (ID, LastName) ); /* Add UNIQUE constraint on ID column */ ALTER TABLE Employee ADD UNIQUE (ID); /* Add UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns */ ALTER TABLE Employee ADD CONSTRAINT UC_Employee UNIQUE (ID, LastName); /* Drop UNIQUE constraint */ ALTER TABLE Employee DROP CONSTRAINT UC_Employee; What is a Primary Key constraint? The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each row in a table. It must contain UNIQUE values and has an implicit NOT NULL constraint. A table can have one and only one primary key, which is comprised of single or multiple columns.\n/* Create table with PRIMARY KEY constraint on ID column */ CREATE TABLE Employee ( ID int NOT NULL, LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL, FirstName varchar(255), Age int, PRIMARY KEY (ID) ); /* Create table with PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns */ CREATE TABLE Employee ( ID int NOT NULL, LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL, FirstName varchar(255), Age int, CONSTRAINT PK_Employee PRIMARY KEY (ID, LastName) ); /* Add PRIMARY KEY constraint on ID column */ ALTER TABLE Employee ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID); /* Add PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns */ ALTER TABLE Employee ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Employee PRIMARY KEY (ID, LastName); /* Drop UNIQUE constraint */ ALTER TABLE Employee DROP CONSTRAINT PK_Employee; What is a Foreign Key constraint? A FOREIGN KEY is a key used to link two tables together.\nA FOREIGN KEY comprises of single or collection of columns in a table that essentially refer to the PRIMARY KEY in another table. Foreign key constraint ensures referential integrity in the relation between two tables.\nThe table containing the foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is called the referenced or parent table.\n/* Department table with ID as PRIMARY KEY */ CREATE TABLE Department ( ID INT NOT NULL, Name VARCHAR(255), PRIMARY KEY (ID) ); /* Employee table with DepartmentID as FOREIGN KEY which is linked to ID column of Department table */ CREATE TABLE Employee ( ID INT NOT NULL, Name VARCHAR(255), DepartmentID INT, PRIMARY KEY (ID), FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Department(ID) ); /* Add FOREIGN KEY constraint on DepartmentID column */ ALTER TABLE Employee ADD CONSTRAINT FK_DepartmentEmployee FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Department(ID); What is Index? An index is a structure in a database that can help retrieve data faster. When you search table data with an SQL query, it will search the whole table and return the result. An unindexed table is called a heap. The data stored in such tables are usually not arranged in any particular way. It is stored in the order it was entered. Therefore, searching for data can be very slow and frustrating.\nWhen you query an indexed table, the database will go to the index first and retrieve the corresponding records directly. The two main index types are:\n Clustered Non-clustered  What is Clustered Index? Clustered index defines the order in which data is physically stored in a table. Therefore, only one clustered index can be created on a given database table.\n Q: What is the maximum number of clustered indexes a table can have?\nA: 1\n This is similar to a physical telephone directory, where the records are sorted by first name, and last name.\nIn SQL Server, the primary key constraint automatically creates a clustered index on that particular column.\nCREATE TABLE Employee ( id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, gender VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL ) CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_tblEmployee_Id ON student(id ASC) Notice that \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; column is primary key in \u0026ldquo;Employee\u0026rdquo; table so clustered index is automatically created for \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; column. The clustered index physically stores and maintains the records in \u0026ldquo;Employee\u0026rdquo; table in the ascending order of \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; even if you insert by records by random \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo;.\nClustered index on \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; make sure that you always get records sorted by \u0026ldquo;id\u0026rdquo; using following statement:-\nSELECT * from Employee What is Non-clustered Index? Non-clustered index doesn’t sort the physical data inside the table. In fact, a non-clustered index is stored at one place and table data is stored in another place.\nThis is similar to a textbook where the book content is located in one place and the index is located in the last few pages. This allows for more than one non-clustered index per table.\n Q: If we create many non-clustered indexes on a table, what operations are likely to be considerably slower than before?\nA: Write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE)\n  Q: When we talk about non-clustered index, how many KEY columns can it have and how many INCLUDED columns?\nA: 16 key columns and unlimited include columns (all table columns can be included).\n  Q: Which datastructure is used generally to create non-clustered indexes on a table?\nA: B and B+ Trees are mostly used. Some of the database also use BitMap data structure to create indexes where cardinality is low.\n What is the difference between Clustered and Non-Clustered Index? Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index    Clustered Index Non-Clustered Index     Can be only one clustered index per table Can create multiple non-clustered indexes on a single table   Clustered indexes only sort tables. Therefore, they do not consume extra storage. Non-clustered indexes are stored in a separate place from the actual table claiming more storage space.   Clustered indexes are faster Non-clustered indexes are slower    What is Composite Index? Whether clustered or non-clustered index, when multiple columns are used to create index then it is known as Composite Index\nCREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_tblEmployee_Name_Gender ON student(name ASC, gender DESC) Note that the sequence of column in Composite Index matters. Above composite index will be used to find records for below queries:-\nSELECT * from Employee where name=\u0026#34;John\u0026#34; and gender=\u0026#34;Male\u0026#34; SELECT * from Employee where name=\u0026#34;Eva\u0026#34; but not for below query:-\nSELECT * from Employee where gender=\u0026#34;Female\u0026#34; What is Cardinality for Database Query Optimization? When it comes to database query optimization, Cardinality refers to number of unique values in a column of a table. We can calculate cardinality using SQL statement:-\nSELECT DISTINCT COUNT(columnName) from tableName; The higher the cardinality of column, the lower the duplicate values in the column. There are three types of SQL cardinality :-\n High Cardinality refers to columns with mostly uncommon or unique values.\nsuch as employee_id, email_address, phone_number columns in Employee Table.\nUnique indexes are used to improve performance of such columns. Normal Cardinality refers to columns with somewhat uncommon values.\nsuch as first_name, last_name columns in Employee Table. Low Cardinality refers to columns with mostly duplicate values\nsuch as gender, joining_year columns in Employee Table.\nBit-map indexes are used to improve the performance of such columns.  How to do Performance tuning of SQL queries? Queries on large databases can have significant execution times. Few ways to optimize SQL queries are as follows:-\n  Use Indexes A straightforward, yet effective, method for query optimization is indexing. This way, the whole database won’t need to be searched for these queries. For example, if a system needed to query first and last names and ID numbers of employees based on their age, the following script could be used to create the index:\nCREATE INDEX age_queries ON Employees (last_name, first_name, id, age);   Use Inner Join instead of Where\nTo link data from two or more tables, the Where clause is used. However, Where uses a kind of join that joins each record of each table and then filters it for the result. This means that if there are 100 records in the Employee table and 100 in the Salary table, it will generate a table of 10,000 records and then check for the correct records for this query.\nSelect Employees.first_name, Employees.last_name, Employees.id From Employees, Salary Where Employees.id = Salary.id; In contrast, if the Inner Join is used, the required records will be produced without anything in the middle.\nSelect Employees.first_name, Employees.last_name, Employees.id From Employees Inner Join Salary On Employees.id = Salary.id;   Use Limit for testing\nBefore running a query on a large database with other potential users, it is advised to use the limit operator to ensure that it actually works. The limit keyword returns a limited number of results from a query, as shown below.\nSelect Employees.first_name, Employees.last_name, Employees.id From Employees Inner Join Salary On Employees.id = Salary.id Where Salary.amount \u0026gt; 4500 Limit 10; This will return only ten names and ID numbers of Employees with salaries greater than 4,500.\n  Use Explain\nWhen querying a large database, it might be smart to use the Explain operator before running the query. Explain displays what is called a Query Plan. The query plan shows which indexing is used, order of execution and the approximate time each step might take. Using this information, more time-expensive steps may be better optimized. The following example shows how to use this operator:\nExplain Select Employees.first_name, Employees.last_name, Employees.id From Employees Inner Join Salary On Employees.id = Salary.id Where Salary.amount \u0026gt; 4500;   Be Specific with Select queries\nWhen working with Select queries, it is smart to avoid the * operator, which returns all columns for the queried records unless otherwise required. Instead, only the required information should be extracted. For example:\nSelect * From Employees; This operation would generate all columns of all records from the Employees table. This is inefficient if only the names were required. In that case, the following query should be used:\nSelect first_name, last_name From Employees;   Find Second Highest Salary from Employee Table? +----+--------+ | Id | Salary | +----+--------+ | 1 | 100 | | 2 | 200 | | 3 | 300 | +----+--------+ SELECT max(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary FROM Employee WHERE Salary \u0026lt; (SELECT max(Salary) FROM Employee) +---------------------+ | SecondHighestSalary | +---------------------+ | 200 | +---------------------+ Find Duplicate Emails from Employee Table? +----+---------+ | Id | Email | +----+---------+ | 1 | a@b.com | | 2 | c@d.com | | 3 | a@b.com | +----+---------+ SELECT Email FROM Employee GROUP BY Email HAVING count(Email) \u0026gt; 1; +---------+ | Email | +---------+ | a@b.com | +---------+ Find Emails starting with vowels (i.e a,e,i,o,u) from Employee Table? +----+-------------------+ | Id | Email | +----+-------------------+ | 1 | adam@gmail.com | | 2 | charlie@yahoo.com | | 3 | david@hotmail.com | | 4 | eva@apple.com | | 5 | fang@bing.com | +----+-------------------+ SELECT Email FROM Employee WHERE Email REGEXP \u0026#34;^[aeiou]\u0026#34;; +------------------+ | Email | +------------------+ | adam@gmail.com | | eva@apple.com | +------------------+ Swap values of gender column in Employee Table?

It insert and search the pair in constant time O(1) in best case. It is backed by an array, also known as hash table. Each index of an array is know as hash bucket. The key is sent to a hash function that performs arithmetic operations on it and returns the index of the key-value pair in the hash table. If hash function of two keys return the same index, it cause hash collision. In this case new pair is linked to the already store pair in that index and form a linked list If a bucket is having more than one key-value pairs linked by a linked list then equals function is used to find the correct key-value pair.  Implementation  Entry\u0026lt;K, V\u0026gt; class to hold key-value pair. It is a generic class which is having key of type K, and value of type V.

T(n) = T(n-3) + log₂(n-2) + log₂(n-1) + log₂(n) T(n) = T(n-k) + log₂1 + log₂2 + ... + log₂(n-1) + log₂(n) Assume (n-k)th is 0th task means n=k T(n) = T(0) + log₂(n)! T(n) = 1 + nlog₂(n) ⋍ nlog₂(n) hence Time Complexity = 𝘖(nlog₂(n))  Example 4 test(int n){ if(n\u0026gt;0){ //statement  test(n-1); test(n-1); } } // T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1 = 𝘖(2ⁿ) Calculation: Base case T(0) = 1 Time taken by nth task:- T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1 T(n-1) = 2T(n-2) + 1 T(n-2) = 2T(n-3) + 1 .. ..

Ω(n) or any notation with lower weightage such as Ω(√n), Ω(log₂n), Ω(1) ... ⍬(n) and only ⍬(n) since this is average bound Ideally you represent the function complexity to nearest type of complexity so in above case 𝘖(n), Ω(n), ⍬(n) are best representations. Example 2 f(n) = 2n² + 3n + 4 1n² ≤ 2n² + 3n + 4 ≤ 9n² can be represented as 𝘖(n²), Ω(n²), or ⍬(n²) Example 3 f(n) = n²log₂n + n n²log₂n ≤ 2n²log₂n + n ≤ 3n²log₂n can be represented as 𝘖(n²log₂n), Ω(n²log₂n), or ⍬(n²log₂n) Example 4 f(n) = !n = nx(n-1)x(n-2)x ...x2x1 = nⁿ n ≤ !n ≤ nⁿ can be represented as 𝘖(nⁿ) upper-bound, Ω(n) lower-bound can not be represented as ⍬ since there is no common average-bound. Example 5 f(n) = log!n = log(nx(n-1)x(n-2)x ...x2x1) = log(nⁿ) = nlog(n) 1 ≤ log!n ≤ nlog(n) can be represented as 𝘖(nlog(n)) upper-bound, Ω(1) lower-bound can not be represented as ⍬ since there is no common average-bound.  It is always preferable to represent complexity in big-theta ⍬, if possible, which is more accurate and tight bound. Big-oh 𝘖(n) is the most popular notation to represent function complexity which you come across.  Note: Do not mix these notations with best case, worst case, or average case time complexity. All type of cases can be represented by 𝘖, Ω, and ⍬ notations.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/coding/time-complexity/","tags":["Algorithm"],"title":"Basics of Time Complexity"},{"categories":["Interview Questions"],"contents":"This System Design Cheat Sheet gives you a quick idea to tackle with the building blocks of any system design interview questions. Keep following this post for regular updates.\nPrimary Database Primary database is your single source of truth when you save data. You always rely on this data.\nWhich database to choose? We always get confused with the database to use as our primary database. Here are some points to keep in mind to make a better decision.\nSQL Database  Relational, Table-based When you require ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties. You choose SQL Database for saving financial transactions which gives you ACID guarantee that multiple records belongs to the same transaction are saved either all or nothing. You choose SQL Database when rigid schema is required. For e.g. you want to maintain strict relationships between the tables. you want to maintain unique, not_null constraints. You choose SQL Database when records are updated very frequently. You choose SQL Database when Joins and complex queries are required. SQL Databases are: Oracle, MySQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL  NoSQL Database  Document-based, key-value pairs, Graph database You choose NoSQL Database when flexible schema is required.\nFor e.g. e-commerce like Amazon can have Products in varied schema. Electronic products can have capacity (lt), power-rating (3-star) whereas Clothing products can have size (S,M,L,XL), material (cotton). You choose NoSQL when horizontal scaling is required. They scale very well. NoSQL Databases are: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Neo4j, and CouchDb  If you need any of the ACID property then use SQL Database else use NoSQL Database.\n\nScalability As your company grow, data grow and scalability comes into picture:-\nVertical Scaling  Database can be scaled vertically by adding more power (CPU, RAM or SSD) to same machine, so that database can handle more load. Vertical scaling has limitations as can not add power to same machine beyond a point. SQL Databases are often scaled vertically  Horizontal Scaling   Databases can be scaled horizontally by adding more machines into the pool of databases. Data is saved in pool of databases using Database Sharding or also known as Horizontal Partitioning\n  Database sharding is easier in NoSQL databases as compare to SQL databases.\nDatabase sharding means partitioning of data in multiple databases. Incoming data can be saved in databases based on some key. for e.g. userId in case of saving user profile.\ntotal database in horizontal partitioning = 5 [DB_1, DB_2, DB_3, DB_4, DB_5] consistent hashing = 5 databases makes a consistent hash ring DB_1 ➚ ↘ DB_5 DB_2 ↖ ↙ DB_4 ⟵ DB_3 write user_1 hash(userId_1) = 1002 database to write this record = 1002%5 = 2 (DB_2) write user_2 hash(userId_2) = 5119 database to write this record = 5119%5 = 4 (DB_4) read user_1 hash(userId_1) = 1002 database to read this record = 1002%5 = 2 (DB_2) DB_4 goes down.... write user_3 hash(userId_3) = 1234 database to write this record = 1234%5 = 4 (DB_4) DB_4 is not available, write to the next available db in consistent hash ring i.e. DB_5    Availability Availability is measured based on replication factor. Replication factor = 3 means a database is having 2 additional copies which keep themselves in-sync asynchronously.\n\nActive-Active Data read and write happen in any database replica.\n(Eventual read and write Consistency, High Availability, High Performance)\n ┌―――――――――――┐ write ➔ | DB_1 | ← read └―――――――――――┘ ⇡⇣ ┌―――――――――――┐ write ➔ | DB_2 | ← read └―――――――――――┘ Eventual Read Consistency:- 1. record_A write request to DB_1 2. record_A read request from DB_2 immediately record_A is not be available in DB_2 if sync is yet to happen Eventual Write Consistency:- 1. record_A write request to DB_1 2. record_A update request to DB_2 immediately record_A is not be available in DB_2 if sync is yet to happen Active-Active is not generally used because eventual write consistency is not acceptable in most of the non-functional requirement.\n\nActive-Passive (Master-Slave) Data read and write happen only in master database. Data is synced with slave database asynchronously. When Master goes down, Slave started serving as master.\n(High read and write Consistency, High Availability, Low Performance)\n ┌―――――――――――――――――――┐ write ➔ | DB_1 (master) | ← read └―――――――――――――――――――┘ ⇣ ┌―――――――――――――――――――┐ | DB_1\u0026quot; (slave) | └―――――――――――――――――――┘ Active-Passive is generally used in financial sector where read and write consistency of financial transactions is very important.\n\nWrite-Read (Master Slave) Data write happen in master database. Data read happen from any database.\n(High write and eventual read Consistency, High Availability, Low write and High read Performance)\n ┌―――――――――――――――――――┐ write ➔ | DB_1 (master) | ← read └―――――――――――――――――――┘ ⇣ ┌―――――――――――――――――――┐ | DB_1\u0026quot; (slave) | ← read └―――――――――――――――――――┘ Write-Read is generally used in social media such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram where read/write ratio is very high and eventual read consistency is acceptable.\n\nCluster When data is partitioned across multiple database\ntotal database in cluster = 5 [DB_1, DB_2, DB_3, DB_4, DB_5] replication factor = 3 consistent hashing = 5 databases makes a consistent hash ring DB_1 ➚ ↘ DB_5 DB_2 ↖ ↙ DB_4 ⟵ DB_3 Data write for DB_1 is copied to DB_2 and DB_3 (next 2 databases in the ring) Data write for DB_2 is copied to DB_3 and DB_4 (next 2 databases in the ring) ... ... Data write for DB_5 is copied to DB_1 and DB_2 (next 2 databases in the ring) In consistent hash ring, next two databases either can contain 100% data copy of previous database or share the 50%-50% data copy depending upon the requirement.\nGeo Sharding Geo sharding is nothing but database sharding based on geo location.\nUse-case  It is used by ride hailing apps such as Uber, Grab to store live locations of drivers and passengers. It is also used by tinder and other dating sites to provide recommendations based on location.  How to do?  Google S2 library divides the geo locations into cells (for e.g. 1 cell = 100x100 miles square). You get the live location (coordinates lat, long) of user and pass to S2 library, which returns the cell_id in which that location falls into. Use this cell_id as a key to partition the data.  Consistent Hashing Consistent hashing is the algorithm used by:\n Most of the load balancers to distribute the load across multiple services. Most of the database horizontal partitioning to distribute the data across multiple databases.  The idea of consistent hashing is to place all the services (or databases) across the consistent hash ring and distribute the load based on some hashing algorithm. This gives us the flexibility to remove or add the service (or database) to the ring without disturbing the whole cluster with minimum or no data loss.\ntotal database in cluster = 5 [DB_1, DB_2, DB_3, DB_4, DB_5] consistent hashing = 5 databases makes a consistent hash ring DB_1 ➚ ↘ DB_5 DB_2 ↖ ↙ DB_4 ⟵ DB_3  If DB_2 goes down, Next database in the ring i.e. DB_3 is going to take additional load (future writes). If replication is not implemented then existing data of DB_2 will be lost but other database will still work. If DB_6 is added newly between DB_5 and DB_1 then it share the 50% load of the next database in the ring i.e. DB_1.  File Storage Options (Image/Video) Scalability E-Commerce like Amazon, Social Media like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Streaming Provider like Netflix requires to store a huge amount of Images and Videos.\nImages and Videos are stored a BLOB (Binary Large Object) and Database Storage is not a good option for this kind of storage. Why?\n You are not going to query on BLOB Storage You do not need any ACID guarantees for BLOB storage as such provided by RDBMS Costly to store in Database  Cheaper and scalable options to store such files are Distributed File Systems (DFS) such as Sharepoint, Amazon S3.\nDetails about the image/video such as its DFS URL, metadata can be save in Database, referred by Image ID.\n   ID URL METADATA IMAGE_THUMBNAIL/VIDEO_COVER_PHOTO    It is also a smart idea to save thumbnail of image, or cover photo of the video in database, size of which should not exceed few KBs. Initially the thumbnail or cover photo can be sent to the client along with the URL of image/video. It is a good experience for the user to see something while image/video is downloading/streaming from DFS.\nAvailability You may want to use Content Delivery Network (CDN) which distribute the same images/videos to different locations geographically near to the client locations.\nCaching You need to use Caching at some point of time in your system design for faster read.\nFew famous Caching solutions are:\n Redis (recommended) Memcached Hazelcast  Text Search Capabilities Almost all the websites requires searching capabilities in one way or another. For e.g. Amazon for product search, Netflix for movies search, Youtube for video search, Social media websites for user profile search, and so and so forth.\nSome of the popular text search engine:\n Elastic Search (recommended) Apache Solr Apache Lucene   Apache Lucene is the core framework written based on Map-Reduce and Inverted-Index algorithm. Elastic Search and Apache Solr has been written on top of Apache Lucene provide additional search capabilities such as fuzzy search, type ahead, search suggestions. You don\u0026rsquo;t rely on these for storage. You generally save data in your primary database and write to Elastic Search or Apache Solr asynchronously.  Reporting and Analytics Data warehouse where you generally dump a lot of data and they provide very complex querying capabilities.\n Apache Hadoop Amazon Redshift Elastic Search  Top Hashing Algorithms Consistent Hashing Consistent Hashing is used to route the request to distributed resources. For e.g.\n Load Balancer use Consistent Hashing algorithm to route the request to specific Application Server. Used in database sharding (also known as horizontal partitioning) to save the date in specific shard.   Bloom Filter Bloom filter takes the constant time and space to answer Yes/No to this kind of questions:-\n Does this username exist or already taken? Is this item exist in the set?  Bloom filter gives:-\n 100% accurate result when it says \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo; Probabilistic result when it says \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo;. Sometimes it might be false positive.  Bloom filter data-structure is represented as an array of bits like this:-\nIndex 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Bit Array | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Case 1 Check username \u0026ldquo;John\u0026rdquo; exist?\nhash1(John) = 100 =\u0026gt; 100%8 = 4 hash2(John) = 54 =\u0026gt; 54%8 = 6 Since 4th and 6th bit of our array is not set, \u0026ldquo;John\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist for sure. Set the bits 4th and 6th bit now:-\nIndex 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Bit Array | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | Case 2 Check username \u0026ldquo;Bill\u0026rdquo; exist?\nhash1(Bill) = 81 =\u0026gt; 81%8 = 1 hash2(Bill) = 31 =\u0026gt; 31%8 = 7 Since 1st and 7th bit of our array is not set, \u0026ldquo;Bill\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist for sure. Set the 1st and 7th bit now:-\nIndex 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Bit Array | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | Case 3 Check username \u0026ldquo;Garry\u0026rdquo; exist?\nhash1(Garry) = 89 =\u0026gt; 89%8 = 1 hash2(Garry) = 90 =\u0026gt; 90%8 = 2 Since 1st bit is set but 2nd bit is not set, \u0026ldquo;Garry\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist for sure. Set the 2nd bit now:-\nIndex 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Bit Array | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | Case 4 Check username \u0026ldquo;Jack\u0026rdquo; exist?\nhash1(Jack) = 89 =\u0026gt; 89%8 = 1 hash2(Jack) = 90 =\u0026gt; 90%8 = 2 Since both 1st and 2nd bit are set, \u0026ldquo;Jack\u0026rdquo; may or may not exist. Check the database.\nConclusion  Number of bits takes very less space and in practice numbers of bits in array can be huge providing more precise results. We have used only 8 bits in the example. Bloom filter provide 100% accurate result if user doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Bloom filter provide estimated result if user exist. Estimated result is more precise if hash function is evenly distributed and more hash functions are used. We have used only 2 hash functions in the example.

Smart Answer: The whole point of having threads is to run them concurrently. If you want to run threads sequentially, better not use them.\nUsing Thread.join() Let\u0026rsquo;s create a task which prints 1 to 100\nclass Task implements Runnable{ int index; Task(int index){ this.index = index; } @Override public void run() {\tfor(int i = 1; i \u0026lt;= 100; i++) { System.out.print(\u0026#34;Thread\u0026#34; + index + \u0026#34;: \u0026#34; + i + \u0026#34; \u0026#34;); } System.out.println(); }\t} Let\u0026rsquo;s create 5 threads to run the tasks sequentially by joining the them one after the another.\nThread t1 = new Thread(new Task(1)); Thread t2 = new Thread(new Task(2)); Thread t3 = new Thread(new Task(3)); Thread t4 = new Thread(new Task(4)); Thread t5 = new Thread(new Task(5)); t1.start(); t1.join(); t2.start(); t2.join(); t3.start(); t3.join(); t4.start(); t4.join(); t5.start(); Using SingleThreadExecutor You can create single thread executor service and submit the task 5 times to execute them sequentially.\nExecutorService service = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(); for(int i=1; i\u0026lt;= 5; i++){ Task task = new Task(i); service.submit(task); } A Task is running in a separate thread. Stop the task if it exceeds 10 minutes. We can use Thread.sleep() to sleep the thread for 10 minutes and Thread.interrupt() to interrupt a thread after 10 minutes.\nWe can interrupt a thread in three ways:-\n Using thread interrupt() Using Executor thread pool shutdownNow() Using Callable returned future cancel()  public class StopThreadAfterTimeout { public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException { usingThreadInterrupt(); //usingThreadPoolShutdownNow(); \t//usingFutureCancel(); \t} private static void usingThreadInterrupt() throws InterruptedException { // 1. create a thread \tThread t1 = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; { while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) { // next step \t} }); // 2. timeout after 10 minutes \tThread.sleep(10 * 60 * 1000); // 3. stop the thread \tt1.interrupt(); } private static void usingThreadPoolShutdownNow() throws InterruptedException { ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2); // 1. create a thread \tthreadPool.submit(() -\u0026gt; { while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) { // next step \t} }); // 2. timeout after 10 minutes \tThread.sleep(10 * 60 * 1000); // 3. stop the thread \tthreadPool.shutdownNow(); // internally call thread interrupt \t} private static void usingFutureCancel() throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException { ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2); // 1. submit new callable task which return future object \tFuture\u0026lt;?\u0026gt; future = service.submit(() -\u0026gt; { while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) { // next step \t} }); // 2. wait for 10 minutes to get response \ttry { future.get(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES); } catch (TimeoutException e) { // 3. stop the thread \tfuture.cancel(true); // internally call thread interrupt \t} } } How to decide Thread Pool Size? It depends on the type of tasks you want to execute:-\n1. CPU Intensive Tasks If you are executing CPU intensive tasks such as cryptographic hash function then max thread pool size should be equal to number of cores in processor.\nFor example a 4 core processor can run only 4 threads at a time so threadPoolSize = 4 is ideal for threads taking lot of CPU.\npublic class IdealThreadPoolSize { public static void main(String[] args) { // get count of available cores \tint coreCount = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors(); ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(coreCount); // submit the tasks for execution \tfor (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 100; i++) { service.execute(new CpuIntestiveTask()); } } static class CpuIntestiveTask implements Runnable { public void run() { // some CPU intensive operations \t} } }  2. IO Intensive Tasks If you are executing IO intensive tasks such as Database or HTTP calls, where threads have a tendency to wait after requesting for the resources. In such case max thread pool size should be larger than the number of cores in processor.\nFor example for a threadPoolSize = 20, if 16 threads are waiting for resources or blocked due to IO operations, other 4 threads can be processed concurrently by 4 core processor.\nIdeal number of threadPoolSize depends on rate of task submission and average task wait time. ThreadPool typically place all the submitted task in BlockingQueue which is thread-safe. Idle threads fetch the task from the queue and process them.\npublic class IdealThreadPoolSize { public static void main(String[] args) { // much higher count for IO tasks \tExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(20); // submit the tasks for execution \tfor (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 100; i++) { service.execute(new IOTask()); } } static class IOTask implements Runnable { public void run() { // some IO operations which will cause thread to block/wait \t} } } What are the types of Executor Thread Pool?  FixedThreadPool - Create a fixed number of threads in the beginning and place them in the pool. SingleThreadExecutor - Create a single thread and place it in the pool. CachedThreadPool - Create a new thread only if all the other threads are busy and place it in the pool. Ideal for short lived tasks. ScheduledThreadPool - Create a fixed number of threads in the beginning and place them in the pool. Create a new thread if all the other threads are busy. Ideal for running the tasks at regular time interval or delay.  // for fixed number of threads ExecutorService fixedThreadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10); // for a pool of single thread ExecutorService singleThreadPool = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(); // for lot of short lived tasks ExecutorService cachedThreadPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool(); // for scheduling of tasks ScheduledExecutorService scheduledThreadPool = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(10); // task to run after 10 second delay scheduledThreadPool.schedule(new Task(), 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // task to run after initial delay of 15 seconds at every 10 second interval scheduledThreadPool.scheduleAtFixedRate(new Task(), 15, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // task to run after initial delay of 15 second at every 10 second after previous task completes scheduledThreadPool.scheduleWithFixedDelay(new Task(), 15, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  Thread Pool Parameters    Thread Pool corePoolSize maxPoolSize keepAliveTime QueueType     FixedTheadPool constr-arg same as core NA LinkedBlockingQueue   SingleThreadExecutor 1 1 NA LinkedBlockingQueue   CachedThreadPool 0 Integer.MAX_VALUE 60s SynchronousQueue   ScheduledThreadPool constr-arg Integer.MAX_VALUE 60s DelayedWorkQueue      Custom Thread Pool If you do not want to use any out of the box available thread pools. You can always create your customize thread pool as below:-\n// custom thread pool ExecutorService customThreadPool = // (corePoolSize: 10, maxPoolSize: 100, keepAliveTime: 120s, QueueType: ArrayBlockingQueue) \tnew ThreadPoolExecutor(10, 100, 120, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(30)); How to customize a thread in Executor Thread Pool? You can implement the newThread() method of class ThreadFactory to spawn custom threads in Executor Thread Pool.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s Generate custom threads and change their names to Test_Thread_\u0026lt;Number\u0026gt;:-\npublic class ExecuterTest { public static void main(String[] args) { ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5, new ExecutorThreadFactory(\u0026#34;Test_Thread_\u0026#34;)); for(int i=1; i\u0026lt;=5; i++){ service.execute(new Task()); }\t} } class Task implements Runnable { @Override public void run() { System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());\t} } class ExecutorThreadFactory implements ThreadFactory { AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(); String threadNamePrefix; ExecutorThreadFactory(String prefix){ this.threadNamePrefix = prefix; } @Override public Thread newThread(Runnable r) { Thread thread = new Thread(r, threadNamePrefix + counter.incrementAndGet()); thread.setDaemon(false); return thread; }\t} Output Test_Thread_1 Test_Thread_4 Test_Thread_3 Test_Thread_2 Test_Thread_5 Runnable vs Callable Interface Runnable and Callable interfaces are used to create a task and submit to thread pool for processing.\n   Runnable Interface Callable Interface     has run() method has call() method   run() do not return value call() return value   run() cannot throw checked exception call() can throw checked exception   execute Runnable task using ExecutorService execute() method submit Callable task using ExecutorService submit() method   execute() do not return anything submit() return Future object    public class RunnableVsCallable { public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException { ExecutorService service = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor(); // execute runnable task which return nothing \tservice.execute(new RunnableTask()); // submit callable task which return Future object \tFuture\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; future = service.submit(new CallableTask()); // get result from future object which is blocking operation \tInteger result = future.get(); // shutdown the thread gracefully \tservice.shutdown(); } static class RunnableTask implements Runnable { @Override public void run() { try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } static class CallableTask implements Callable\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; { @Override public Integer call() throws InterruptedException { Thread.sleep(1000); return new Random().nextInt(); } } } Synchronized Block vs Reentrant Lock  Reentrant locks are explicit, whereas Synchronized block is implicit Reentrant locks provides flexibility to lock/unlock in any scopes, whereas Synchronized block scope is limited to curly braces {}\nIn below example lock() is outside and unlock() is inside the try-finally block. private static ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(); private static void accessResource() { lock.lock(); try{ // access the resource  }finally{ lock.unlock(); } } public static void main(String[] args){ Thread t1 = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; accessResource)); t1.start(); Thread t2 = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; accessResource)); t2.start(); Thread t3 = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; accessResource)); t3.start(); } The same accessResource() method using Synchronized block:\nprivate static void accessResource() { synchronized(this) { // equivalent to lock.lock()  // access the resource  } // equivalent to lock.unlock() }  Reentrant locks lock() can be called multiple times without calling unlock() method hence the name reentrant.\nCalling lock() two times means lock inside lock. You need to call unlock() two times as well to come out of the lock completely. Reentrant locks are unfair by default. You can enable fairness by passing boolean true new ReentrantLock(true) in constructor. Fairness provides more chance to acquire lock to the threads waited for longest time in the queue. Performance is slow when fairness is turned on. Reentrant locks provide ability to tryLock() and tryLock(timeout) private static void accessResource() { boolean lockAcquired = lock.tryLock(); // boolean lockAcquired = lock.tryLock(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  if(lockAcquired) { lock.lock(); try{ // access the resource  }finally{ lock.unlock(); } } else { // do something else  } }   Reentrant Lock vs ReadWrite Lock  ReentrantLock consist of only one lock, only one thread can acquire that lock at a time ReentrantReadWriteLock consist of ReadLock and WriteLock. Though they are two separate instances, either read or write operation is allowed at a time.\nEither one thread can acquire a write lock or multiple threads can acquire a read lock at a time.  Both ReadLock and WriteLock use the same Queue behind the scene waiting for their turn.\npublic class ReadWriteLock { private ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock(); private ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock readLock = lock.readLock(); private ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock writeLock = lock.writeLock(); private void readResource() { readLock.lock(); // read the resource \treadLock.unlock(); } private void writeResource() { writeLock.lock(); // write the resource \twriteLock.unlock(); } public static void main(String[] args) { ReadWriteLock obj = new ReadWriteLock(); Thread t1 = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; obj.readResource()); t1.start(); Thread t2 = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; obj.readResource()); t2.start(); Thread t3 = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; obj.writeResource()); t3.start(); Thread t4 = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; obj.writeResource()); t4.start(); Thread t5 = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; obj.readResource()); t5.start(); //t1,t2 can read at the same time \t//t3,t4 can not write when t1,t2 are reading \t//t4 can not write when t3 is writing \t//t5 can not read when t3 is writing \t}\t} What is volatile keyword? Each thread runs in one core of multi-core processor. Each Core has their own local cache. All the cores share one shared cache.\n thread-1 thread-2 ┌―――――――――――――┐―――――――――――――┐ | Core 1 | Core 2 | |―――――――――――――|―――――――――――――| | Local Cache | Local Cache | |―――――――――――――┘―――――――――――――| | Shared Cache | └―――――――――――――――――――――――――――┘ When you apply volatile keyword to a property. Any updates in that property done by thread-1 in local-cache is pushed down to shared-cache to make sure that the update is visible to thread-2\nvolatile boolean flag = true; volatile keyword doesn\u0026rsquo;t work when you do compound operations such as count++ which is read, increment and write back. In such case we can use AtomicInteger or AtomicLong\n   Type Use Case     volatile Flags   AtomicInteger, AtomicLong Counters    What is ThreadLocal Object? ThreadLocal object is used to create object per thread instances for memory efficiency and thread-safety.\nIn the below example, We have created a threadPool of 10 threads and submitted 1000 tasks. Here 10 ThreadLocal dtFormat objects will be created, one for each thread.\ndtFormat.get() method make sure that it returns the object of the currently running thread out of those 10 dtFormat objects.\nclass ThreadSafeFormatter { public static ThreadLocal\u0026lt;SimpleDateFormat\u0026gt; dtFormat = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -\u0026gt; new SimpleDateFormat(\u0026#34;yyyy-MM-dd\u0026#34;)); } public class UserService { private static ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10); public static void main(String[] args){ for(int i=0; i\u0026lt;1000; i++){ int id = i; threadPool.submit(() -\u0026gt; new UserService().birthDate(id)); } } public String birthDate(int userId){ Date birthDate = birthDateFromDb(userId); final SimpleDateFormat dtFormat = ThreadSafeFormatter.dtFormat.get(); return dtFormat.format(birthDate); } } What is Semaphore? Semaphore is used when you want to limit maximum number of concurrent calls to a particular resource in multi-threaded environment.\npublic class Semaphore { public void acquire(); public void release(); } Semaphore(3) means only 3 threads can acquire() a lock and use resources at a time. As soon as one thread out of 3 release() the lock, 4th thread can acquire() the lock and use the resources.\npublic class SemaphoreTest { public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {\t// ThreadPool of 50 threads \tExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(50); // Semaphore to rum max 3 concurrent calls \tSemaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3); // Execute 1000 tasks (initiate 1000 threads) to test \tIntStream.of(1000).forEach(i -\u0026gt; service.execute(new Task(semaphore))); // Shutdown the ExecutorService gracefully \tservice.shutdown(); service.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES); } static class Task implements Runnable { private Semaphore semaphore; Task(Semaphore semaphore) { this.semaphore = semaphore; } @Override public void run() {\t// Start code -\u0026gt; can be executed by 50 threads concurrently \t// since thread pool size is 50  try { // Only 3 threads can acquire lock at a time since semaphore count is 3 \t// Other threads wait here. \tsemaphore.acquire(); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } // Slow Code -\u0026gt; Heavy operations like IO \t// can be executed by only 3 threads  // Release the lock for other threads to come in Slow code \tsemaphore.release(); // End code -\u0026gt; can be executed by 50 threads concurrently \t// since thread pool size is 50 \t} } } What is CountDownLatch? CountDownLatch is used when we want our main thread to wait until all the dependent services are initialized and up.\npublic class CountDownLatch { public void countDown(); public void await(); }  Create a latch = CountDownLatch(3) means three services to be initialized before main thread. Each service call latch.countDown() after initializing which decrement the countdown by 1. Main thread waits for all services to be initialized (until countdown reaches zero) using latch.await(). Once all 3 services are initialized (countdown reaches zero), main thread start doing its job.  public class CountDownLatchTest { public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException{ CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3); Thread cacheService = new Thread(new Service(\u0026#34;Cache Service\u0026#34;, latch)); Thread alertService = new Thread(new Service(\u0026#34;Alert Service\u0026#34;, latch)); Thread validationService = new Thread(new Service(\u0026#34;Validation Service\u0026#34;, latch)); cacheService.start(); alertService.start(); validationService.start(); latch.await(); //wait here till latch count reaches 0 then only process next line of code. \tSystem.out.println(\u0026#34;All Services are up and running. Main Thread started processing...\u0026#34;);\t} static class Service implements Runnable{ private String name; private CountDownLatch latch; Service(String name, CountDownLatch latch){ this.name = name; this.latch = latch; } @Override public void run() { // startup task \tSystem.out.println(name + \u0026#34; is up\u0026#34;); latch.countDown(); // continue w/ other tasks \t}\t} } Output Cache Service is up Validation Service is up Alert Service is up All Services are up and running. Main Thread started processing... How to start 5 threads at the same time? Well, you can have max number of parallel threads run at the same time is equal to number of cores in CPU. If you have a 4 cores CPU, only 4 threads can start at the exact same time.\nThough the idea of the question is if you have any Java concurrency feature which allows you to trigger the threads at the same time. Answer is CountDownLatch.\n Create a CountDownLatch of 5 Create and start all the 5 threads All the threads wait until CountDownLatch reaches zero All the threads start at the same time from that point  public class StartThreadsAtSameTime { public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException { // Initialize Countdown = 5 \tCountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(5); // Initialize and start 5 threads passing the same latch object \tfor (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++) { Thread t = new Thread(new Task(latch)); t.start(); } // All threads wait until Countdown = 0  // Decrement the Countdown 5 times \tfor (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++) { latch.countDown(); } // Countdown = 0 at this point \t// All threads start printing at this point \t} static class Task implements Runnable { private CountDownLatch latch; Task(CountDownLatch latch) { this.latch = latch;} @Override public void run() { try { // thread wait for Countdown = 0 \tlatch.await(); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \u0026#34; is running\u0026#34;); } } } What is CyclicBarrier? CyclicBarrier is used when two or more threads are required to reach at certain barrier point.\n They wait for each other at barrier point using await(). Once all reach at barrier point, they start from there again. Since it is a CyclicBarrier, at this point, cycle is reset. All three threads wait again at next barrier point using await() Once all reach at next barrier point, they start from there again. This cycle goes on\u0026hellip;  public class CyclicBarrierTest { public static void main(String[] args) { CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3); Thread t1 = new Thread(new Task(barrier)); Thread t2 = new Thread(new Task(barrier)); Thread t3 = new Thread(new Task(barrier)); t1.start(); t2.start(); t3.start(); } static class Task implements Runnable { private CyclicBarrier barrier; Task(CyclicBarrier barrier) { this.barrier = barrier;} @Override public void run() { while(true) { String threadName = Thread.currentThread().getName(); System.out.println(threadName + \u0026#34; running towards barrier\u0026#34;); try { barrier.await(); // wait for other threads to reach at barrier point \t} catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } // barrier cycle is reset at this point  System.out.println(threadName + \u0026#34; crossed barrier\u0026#34;);\ttry { Thread.sleep(1000); // just sleep for a while to verify in console \t} catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }\t} } } Output Thread-0 running towards barrier Thread-2 running towards barrier Thread-1 running towards barrier Thread-1 crossed barrier Thread-0 crossed barrier Thread-2 crossed barrier Thread-1 running towards barrier Thread-2 running towards barrier Thread-0 running towards barrier Thread-0 crossed barrier Thread-1 crossed barrier Thread-2 crossed barrier ... ... ... Retrieve Price from N Sources Asynchronously We can implement a Scatter Gather Pattern using CompletableFuture where we run three tasks asynchronously to fetch price of a product from 3 websites.\nNote that when you call CompletableFuture.runAsync(Runnable runnable) then Java runs this in a separate thread of ForkJoinPool.commonPool() thread pool by default. You do not need to create any separate thread pool.\nAlso note that CompletableFuture.get() method is blocking operations. We do not want our pricing result to wait forever if any website is down thatswhy we have given a timeout of 5 seconds.\nWe wait for them for max 5 seconds and return the prices. Two things can happen:-\n If all three tasks completed (run method executed) within 4 seconds, prices from all websites are returned at 4th second. If only two tasks are completed within 5 seconds, prices from only two websites are returned at 5th second.\n  public class ScatterGatherPattern { public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException { ScatterGatherPattern scatterGather = new ScatterGatherPattern(); scatterGather.getPrices(1); } private Set\u0026lt;Double\u0026gt; getPrices(int productId) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException, TimeoutException { Set\u0026lt;Double\u0026gt; prices = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;()); CompletableFuture\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt; task1 = CompletableFuture.runAsync(new Task(\u0026#34;amazon.com\u0026#34;, productId, prices)); CompletableFuture\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt; task2 = CompletableFuture.runAsync(new Task(\u0026#34;ebay.com\u0026#34;, productId, prices)); CompletableFuture\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt; task3 = CompletableFuture.runAsync(new Task(\u0026#34;wallmart.com\u0026#34;, productId, prices)); CompletableFuture\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt; allTasks = CompletableFuture.allOf(task1, task2, task3); // wait for all the taks to complete, but max for 5 seconds \tallTasks.get(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS); //blocking operation  return prices; } private static class Task implements Runnable { private String url; private int productId; private Set\u0026lt;Double\u0026gt; set; Task(String url, int productId, Set\u0026lt;Double\u0026gt; set) { this.url = url; this.productId = productId; this.set = set; } @Override public void run() { double price = 0; // make http call (url, productId) to get price \tset.add(price); } } } What is DeadLock. How to Detect and Avoid them? Deadlock is a situation where:-\n thread_1 acquires lock_A and waiting to acquire lock_B thread_2 acquires lock_B and waiting to acquire lock_A  Now both thread_1 and thread_2 will wait for each other indefinitely and result into deadlock situation.\npublic class DeadlockTest { private Lock lockA = new ReentrantLock(); private Lock lockB = new ReentrantLock(); public static void main(String[] args){ DeadlockTest test = new DeadlockTest(); test.execute(); } private void execute() { new Thread(this::processThis).start(); new Thread(this::processThat).start(); } private void processThis() { lockA.lock(); System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \u0026#34; processing resource A\u0026#34;); lockB.lock(); System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \u0026#34; processing resource B\u0026#34;); lockA.unlock(); lockB.unlock(); } private void processThat() { lockB.lock(); System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \u0026#34; processing resource B\u0026#34;); lockA.lock(); System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + \u0026#34; processing resource A\u0026#34;); lockA.unlock(); lockB.unlock(); } }  How to detect a DeadLock? Deadlock can be detected at runtime by creating Thread dump of the application which represent the state of the application at that point of time.\nWe can use tools such as VisualVM, JProfiler, YourKit to get the thread dump. We can also use any of the following commands to get the thread dump:-\nkill -3 \u0026lt;process_id\u0026gt; jstack \u0026lt;process_id\u0026gt; \u0026gt; ./out.txt Alternatively we can run this program constantly in the background to check for deadlocks:-\nprivate static void detectedDeadLock() { ThreadMXBean threadBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean(); long[] threadIds = threadBean.findDeadlockedThreads(); boolean deadLock = threadIds != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; threadIds.length \u0026gt; 0; System.out.println(\u0026#34;DeadLock found: \u0026#34; + deadLock); }  How to avoid a DeadLock?  Use timeouts while acquiring locks if possible, so that thread do not wait for indefinitely  Lock lock = new ReentrantLock(); lock.tryLock(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  If same locks are used in different methods, try to acquire the locks in same order.  private void processThis() { lockA.lock(); lockB.lock(); // ... } private void processThat() { lockA.lock(); lockB.lock(); // ... } Parallelism vs Concurrency    Parallelism Concurrency     Doing a lot of things at once Dealing with lot of things at once   If your machine is having 4 core CPU then you can run at most 4 tasks in parallel If your Java ThreadPool size is 20 then you can run at most 20 tasks concurrently in different threads   If you have 1 core CPU, you can not achieve Parallelism If you have 1 core CPU, you can still achieve Concurrency   If you have ThreadPool of size 1, you can still achieve Parallelism If you have ThreadPool of size 1, you can not achieve Concurrency    Let\u0026rsquo;s look at various use cases to understand the difference:-\nConcurrent, but not Parallel If machine is having 1 core CPU and you are using ThreadPool of size 20. Say you submit 20 similar tasks to ThreadPool.\nAt any moment, all the 20 similar tasks are in progress (concurrency=20), and only one tasks is actually running on CPU (parallelism=1) while others are waiting.\nParallel, but not Concurrent If machine is having 4 core CPU and you are using 20 ThreadPools of size 1. Say you submit 20 different tasks to each ThreadPool.\nAt any moment, all the 20 different types of tasks are in progress, and only 1 similar type of task in progress (concurrency=1), and 4 tasks are actually running on CPU (parallelism=4) while others are waiting.\nPlease note that we say tasks are running concurrently only when they are similar tasks, or they are accessing/updating same resources, or they need to coordinate.\nNot Parallel, not Concurrent If machine is having 1 core CPU and you are using ThreadPool of size 1. Say you submit 20 similar tasks to ThreadPool.\nAt any moment, Only 1 task is in progress (concurrency=1), and only one tasks is actually running on CPU (parallelism=1) while no one is waiting.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/java-multithreading-interview-questions/","tags":["Interview Q\u0026A","Java Q\u0026A"],"title":"Java Multithreading (Concurrency) Interview Questions"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"This problem is frequently asked in the interview to check your understanding on threads and your programming skills. Problem statement might change for e.g.\n Print ping pong using two threads. Print alternate number using two threads. Print even numbers by one thread and odd numbers by another thread.  Using Wait Notify We can print the \u0026ldquo;Ping Pong\u0026rdquo; alternatively using Wait Notify. This is what happen behind the scene:-\n 1st thread print \u0026ldquo;Ping\u0026rdquo; and go to wait state. 2nd thread wakes up from wait state, print \u0026ldquo;Ping\u0026rdquo;, notify 1st thread, goes back to wait state. 1st thread wakes up from wait state, print \u0026ldquo;Pong\u0026rdquo;, notify 2nd thread, goes back to wait state.

Things to note in above program:\n wait() and notify() are Object\u0026rsquo;s method so you need to create a LOCK_OBJECT to call these methods. You pass this LOCK_OBJECT from constructor. Both threads try to acquire a lock on LOCK_OBJECT, when one thread is having lock on this object, other thread can not access the resources. wait() and notify() methods can only be called within the Synchronized Block. wait() and notify() methods are called inside while(true) loop to keep running the thread. wait() and sleep() method throw InterruptedException exception. The sleep() method is optional. It is used to add a delay of 1 sec in printing \u0026ldquo;Ping\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Pong\u0026rdquo; in order to verify the sequence in console.  Using ReentrantLock Condition ReentrantLock locks are new in Java, which provide Condition having two methods await() and signal().

X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.  \nRomanize Number Javascript method used in this converter to convert from Decimal Number to Roman:-\nconst romanize = (number) =\u0026gt;

Therefore, we need to use some prefixes to define hierarchical configuration such as below example, where spring.datasource is a prefix for url, username, and password configuration.\nspring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/test spring.datasource.username=SA spring.datasource.password=password application.yml On the other hand .yml files are very convenient to define hierarchical data which is very similar to JSON format\nspring: datasource: url: jdbc:mysql://localhost/test username: SA password: password Clearly YAML file is more readable as compare to Properties file.\n Note that you use consistent spaces in next line to represent nested data in YAML file.\n List Configuration application.properties If you have a list of configurations then they can be defined in .properties file -\n Individually in different line using indices such as servers[0], server[1] \u0026hellip;

} Profile Based Configuration A common practice in Spring Boot configuration is to have YAML or Properties file for each profile (environment) - test, dev, staging, prod.\nSpring Boot picks up .properties or .yml files in the following sequence:-\n application-{profile}.properties | .yml application.properties | .yml  We can pass the profile (for e.g. prod) from command-line argument for e.g. --spring.profiles.active=prod or from application.properties | .yml\napplication.properties In case of multiple profiles, each profile is configured in different application-{profile}.properties file.\napplication.properties\n#Logging logging.level.root=ERROR logging.level.org.springframework.web=INFO logging.level.com.codingnconcepts=DEBUG #spring spring.main.banner-mode=off spring.profiles.active=dev server.email=default@codingnconcepts.com application-dev.properties\n#dev environment server.email: dev@codingnconcepts.com server.cluster[0].ip=127.0.0.1 server.cluster[0].path=/dev1 server.cluster[1].ip=127.0.0.2 server.cluster[1].path=/dev2 server.cluster[2].ip=127.0.0.3 server.cluster[2].path=/dev3 application-prod.properties\n#production environment server.email: prod@codingnconcepts.com server.cluster[0].ip=192.168.0.1 server.cluster[0].path=/app1 server.cluster[1].ip=192.168.0.2 server.cluster[1].path=/app2 server.cluster[2].ip=192.168.0.3 server.cluster[2].path=/app3 Properties which are not configured in application-{profile}.properties such as logging.level, are picked up from application.properties file.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s pass different profiles using command-line arguments:-\n# The \u0026#39;dev\u0026#39; profile is configured in application.properties # Profile: dev, picks application-dev.properties or YAML $ java -jar target/spring-boot-profile-1.0.jar ServerProperties{email=\u0026#39;dev@codingnconcepts.com\u0026#39;, cluster=[ Cluster{ip=\u0026#39;127.0.0.1\u0026#39;, path=\u0026#39;/dev1\u0026#39;}, Cluster{ip=\u0026#39;127.0.0.2\u0026#39;, path=\u0026#39;/dev2\u0026#39;}, Cluster{ip=\u0026#39;127.0.0.3\u0026#39;, path=\u0026#39;/dev3\u0026#39;} ]} # Profile: prod, picks application-prod.properties or YAML $ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=prod target/spring-boot-profile-1.0.jar ServerProperties{email=\u0026#39;prod@codingnconcepts.com\u0026#39;, cluster=[ Cluster{ip=\u0026#39;192.168.0.1\u0026#39;, path=\u0026#39;/app1\u0026#39;}, Cluster{ip=\u0026#39;192.168.0.2\u0026#39;, path=\u0026#39;/app2\u0026#39;}, Cluster{ip=\u0026#39;192.168.0.3\u0026#39;, path=\u0026#39;/app3\u0026#39;} ]} # Profile: abc, a non-existent profile $ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=abc target/spring-boot-profile-1.0.jar ServerProperties{email=\u0026#39;null\u0026#39;, cluster=[]} \napplication.yml We can create multiple profiles in single .yml file by using three dashes ---.\nlogging: level: root: ERROR org.springframework.web: INFO com.codingnconcepts: DEBUG spring: profiles: active: \u0026quot;dev\u0026quot;

For example:\n When you click on a Combo Box, drop down values are displayed as an overlay When you click or hover on a Menu, list of submenu(s) are displayed as an overlay When you click or hover on an Icon, tooltip is displayed as an overlay When you start typing in a Search Box, search suggestions are displayed as an overlay  One thing common in all those overlay elements is that as soon as their origin element (such as Combo Box, Menu, Icon, or Search Box) loose focus, they disappear.\nI have had a hard time inspecting and debugging the CSS of these overlay elements since they disappear as soon as I click on Chrome DevTool Inspect ⬉ Icon. Until I found this cool trick.\nInspect Overlay Elements Using Break on subtree modifications We\u0026rsquo;ll inspect the Google search suggestions overlay which appears while typing in Search Box. Follow the steps:\n First of all we need to open a Chrome DevTool. We can do it in multiple ways:  From Chrome’s main menu, select More tools ➞ Developer tools Right Click near the element, select inspect   Click on DevTool\u0026rsquo;s Elements Tab. Right Click on \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; HTML element. Select Break on ➞ subtree modifications  That\u0026rsquo;s it. Now when you start typing in Google search box. Search suggestion appears as an overlay elements which is the DOM modification, breakpoint is applied on the \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; element and freeze the browser.\nNow you can inspect the search suggestions overlay element, it will not disappear.\nNote: You are applying the break on \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; elements so you will see undesired breakpoints as you start typing in the search box. Keep pressing F8 to skip those breakpoints until your overlay element appears.\n Chrome DevTool Break on Subtree Modifications\n  \nUsing Break on attribute modifications We\u0026rsquo;ll inspect Amazon Sign in overlay menu which appears on hover on Account. Follow the steps:\n Open Chrome DevTool Click on DevTool\u0026rsquo;s Elements Tab Inspect the Account menu element using Inspect Icon ⬉. It will focus that particular HTML element in Element tab Right Click on \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; HTML element Select Break on ➞ attribute modifications   Chrome DevTool Break on Attribute Modifications\n  That’s it. Now when you hover on Account menu. It modifies the class attribute of \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; element, which is an attribute modification, breakpoint is applied on the \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; element and freeze the browser.\nNow you can inspect the Overlay menu, it will not disappear.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/inspect-overlay-elements-chrome-devtools/","tags":["Javascript Console"],"title":"Inspect Overlay Elements using Chrome DevTools"},{"categories":["Interview Questions"],"contents":"These manual testing interview questions are based on my personal interview experience and feedback from other interviewees. Keep following this post for regular updates.\nQ1. What is the difference between Regression and Retesting ?  Regression Testing is performed to check unexpected side-effects even any code change has not unfavorably disturbed current features \u0026amp; functions of an Application. Retesting is a process to check specific test cases that are found with bug/s in the final execution.  Q2. What will be your approach if you are not clear about the requirement?  I will look for specification documents if available and try to understand the requirement on my own. In case of any issue, I will approach BA for clarification. If BAs are also not clear, request them to confirm the requirement from business users. I will also take help from my peers if they have a clear understanding of the requirement.  Q3. Are you familiar with Agile and Scrum Methodologies? How they are different from others? Agile is a continuous iteration of development and testing in the software development process which allows changed in project development requirement with an increment approach.\nQ4. What are the Scrum Ceremonies? Scrum is executed inside what are called Sprints and every Sprint is a short iterations of work which is usually of two weeks or lesser. A sprint has four different scrum ceremonies to ensure proper execution:\n Sprint Planning Meeting -\nWhat are we going to work on, and how are we going to do it? Daily Stand-up Meeting -\nWhat’s done on the prior day, what needs to be done today, identify any impediments, and creates visibility around the work that everyone is doing in the Sprint. Sprint Review Meeting -\nBased on stack holders feedback, items will be looped back into the Product Backlog, where it can be added in the future Sprint. Scrum Retrospective Meeting -\nWhat went well, what did not and what can be improved.  Q4. What are SDLC and STLC?  SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle, which is a sequence of different activities performed during the software development process. STLC stands for Software Testing Life Cycle, which is a sequence of different activities performed during software testing process.  Q5. What is Defect Life Cycle? A defect life cycle represents the flow of bug from newly open to until it closes. Simpler implementations of the bug life cycle may not include all the states, The defect life cycle can vary from organization to organization and also from project to project based on several factors like organization policy, software development model.\nIt has different states as mentioned below -\nNew Assigned Open Fixed Pending Retest Retest Verified Reopen Closed Duplicate Rejected Deferred Not a Bug  Q6. How do you raise a defect in HP QC and what parameters you key in? To log a new defect in HP QC we navigate to Defects Tab -\u0026gt; New Defect. while adding a new test case we key in Parameters as follows - Summary Assigned to Detected in Release Project Status Priority Reproducible Description Attachment (Screenshots of error) Linked entities (If required)\nQ7. How do you write a test case, what parameters you key in? For adding a test case we key in Parameter as follows :- Test case Id Release Project Version Pre-requisite Test Data Test Objective Test Steps / description Actual result Expected result Status\nQ8. What is the prerequisite to login on the home page?  User should have required access and credential for login on website. User should have compatible browser version.  Q9. Suppose 10 tasks are assigned to 4 developers in a sprint. What will be your approach to test those development tasks? Initially, my approach will be to test module wise and later will perform end to end testing once all developer code is ready to test.\nQ10. What is priority and severity? Priority is defined degree of fix and severity says how early it has to be fixed. The tester can set defect priority in case he/she is blocked to run further scenarios which are interdependent.\nThere is four combinations for these terms as follows -\n Low severity and low priority\nExample - A website’s privacy policy, or disclaimer came across a typo error, or you noticed that the colour-font is not as per your website’s theme. It is not as it should be so it is a bug, however, since it is not affecting the functionality of your web-app, and also because it wouldn’t be noticed by the majority of users. It would be okay to keep it as low severity and low priority. High severity and high priority\nExample - On an eCommerce website, every customers get error message on the booking form and cannot place orders, or the product page throws a Error 500 response. Low severity and High priority\nExample - Latest browser version, shows that the buttons are slightly overlapping with each other. Although, they are still clickable separately, the visual representation is getting disturbed. High severity and Low priority\nExample - Customers who uses very old browsers cannot continue with their purchase of a product. Because the number of customers with very old browsers is very low, it is a low priority to fix the issue.  Q11. You have submitted the form and details will be saved in DB and result can be verified on third-party platform, What will be your test steps? Test case steps are as follows :-\n Login to Page with valid credentials. Submit the form with required details. Verify expected response on web. Verify the submitted details Saved correctly on a third-party platform.  Q12. Your test outcome will reflect on a third-party platform, What will be your approach if third-party platform is down? I will follow-up with the concerned team regarding this and will execute my test cases once it’s accessible.\nQ13. What is static and dynamic testing? Under Static Testing, code is not executed. It manually checks the code, requirement documents, and design documents to find errors. Hence, the name \u0026ldquo;static\u0026rdquo;. The main objective of this testing is to improve the quality of software products by finding errors in the early stages of the development cycle so it is a kind of verification process.\nUnder Dynamic Testing, a code is executed. It checks for functional behavior of software system, memory/CPU usage, and overall performance of the system. The main objective of this testing is to confirm that the software product works in conformance with the business requirements. This testing is also called an Execution technique or validation testing.\nQ14. What is Sanity testing? Sanity testing is a subset of regression testing. After receiving the software build, sanity testing is performed to ensure that the code changes introduced are working as expected. This testing is a checkpoint to determine if testing for the build can proceed or not.\nQ15. What is the SQL query to fetch the no of records from the Database Table? Select count * from table Employee.\nQ16. What is different Test Techniques? Test Techniques are as follows -\n Black Box Testing - also known as Specification based testing, analyses the functionality of a software/application without knowing much about the internal structure/design of the item. White Box Testing - also known as Structure based testing, requires a profound knowledge of the code as it includes testing of some structural part of the application. Experience Based Testing - Its a constant approach to studies, analyzes the product and accordingly applies his skills, traits, and experience to develop test strategy and test cases to perform necessary testing.

Resources are not limited to XML, as the term suggest which is confusing. The term AJAX is also used to fetch resources as JSON, HTML, or Plain Text. You may have heard that term already.\nThere are multiple ways to make network request and fetch data from the server. We\u0026rsquo;ll look at them one by one.\nXMLHttpRequest The XMLHttpRequest object (also known as XHR in short) is used in older days to retrieve data from the server asynchronously.\nThe XML comes in the name because it is first used to retrieve XML data. Now this can also be used to retrieve JSON, HTML or Plain text.\nExample: GET function success() { var data = JSON.parse(this.responseText); console.log(data); } function error(err) { console.log(\u0026#39;Error Occurred :\u0026#39;, err); } var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.onload = success; xhr.onerror = error; xhr.open(\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1\u0026#34;); xhr.send(); We see that to make a simple GET request, we need two listeners to handle success and failure of the request. We also need to make calls to open() and send() methods. The response from the server is stored in the responseText variable, which is converted to JavaScript object using JSON.parse().\nExample: POST function success() { var data = JSON.parse(this.responseText); console.log(data); } function error(err) { console.log(\u0026#39;Error Occurred :\u0026#39;, err); } var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr.onload = success; xhr.onerror = error; xhr.open(\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\u0026#34;); xhr.setRequestHeader(\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;application/json; charset=UTF-8\u0026#34;); xhr.send(JSON.stringify({ title: \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39;, body: \u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;, userId: 1 }) ); We see that POST request is similar to GET request. We need to additionally set the request header \u0026ldquo;Content-Type\u0026rdquo; using setRequestHeader and send the JSON body as string using JSON.stringify in the send method.\nXMLHttpRequest vs Fetch We have used XMLHttpRequest for several years to request data. The modern fetch() API allows you to make network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest (XHR). The main difference is that the fetch() API uses Promises, which enables a simpler and cleaner API, avoiding callback hell and having to remember the complex API of XMLHttpRequest.\nFetch API Fetch is a native JavaScript API to make AJAX calls which is supported by most of the browsers and widely used now a days.\nAPI Usage fetch(url, options) .then(response =\u0026gt; { // handle response data  }) .catch(err =\u0026gt; { // handle errors  });  API Arguments The fetch() API takes two arguments:\n url is a mandatory argument, which is a path to the resource you want to fetch. options is an optional argument. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to provide this argument to make simple GET request. You need to pass this argument to provide additional information about the request such as  method: GET | POST | PUT | DELETE | PATCH headers: Request Headers Object for e.g. { \u0026ldquo;Content-type\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;application/json; charset=UTF-8\u0026rdquo; } mode: cors | no-cors | same-origin | navigate cache: default | reload | no-cache body: Request body generally used in POST request\n    API returns Promise Object The fetch() API returns a promise object.\n The promise is rejected if there is a network error, this is handled in the .catch() block. The promise is resolved if there is a response from the server with any status code such as 200, 404, 500. Response Object can be handled in the .then() block.\n  Error Handling Please note that we expect status code as 200 (OK status) for successful response but fetch() API resolved the promise even if response is coming with error status code such as 404 (Resource Not found) and 500 (Internal Server Error). We need to handle those explicitly in .then() block.\nWe can see HTTP-status in response object:\n status – HTTP status code, e.g. 200. ok – boolean, true if the HTTP status code is 200-299.\n  Example: GET const getTodoItem = fetch(\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\u0026#39;) .then(response =\u0026gt; response.json()) .catch(err =\u0026gt; console.error(err)); getTodoItem.then(response =\u0026gt; console.log(response)); Response ➤ { userId: 1, id: 1, title: \u0026quot;delectus aut autem\u0026quot;, completed: false } Two things to note in above code:-\n fetch API returns a promise object which we can assign to a variable and execute later. You have to additionally call response.json() to convert response object to JSON\n  Error Handling Let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens when HTTP GET request throw 500 error:-\nfetch(\u0026#39;http://httpstat.us/500\u0026#39;) // this API throw 500 error  .then(response =\u0026gt; () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#34;Inside first then block\u0026#34;); return response.json(); }) .then(json =\u0026gt; console.log(\u0026#34;Inside second then block\u0026#34;, json)) .catch(err =\u0026gt; console.error(\u0026#34;Inside catch block:\u0026#34;, err)); Inside first then block ➤ ⓧ Inside catch block: SyntaxError: Unexpected token I in JSON at position 4 We see that even though API throw 500 error, It still goes inside first then() block where it\u0026rsquo;s not able to parse error JSON and throw error which is caught by catch() block.\nThat means we need to handle such errors explicitly like this if we are using fetch() API:-\nfetch(\u0026#39;http://httpstat.us/500\u0026#39;) .then(handleErrors) .then(response =\u0026gt; response.json()) .then(response =\u0026gt; console.log(response)) .catch(err =\u0026gt; console.error(\u0026#34;Inside catch block:\u0026#34;, err)); function handleErrors(response) { if (!response.ok) { // throw error based on custom conditions on response  throw Error(response.statusText); } return response; } ➤ Inside catch block: Error: Internal Server Error at handleErrors (Script snippet %239:9) \nExample: POST fetch(\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos\u0026#39;, { method: \u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;, body: JSON.stringify({ completed: true, title: \u0026#39;new todo item\u0026#39;, userId: 1 }), headers: { \u0026#34;Content-type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;application/json; charset=UTF-8\u0026#34; } }) .then(response =\u0026gt; response.json()) .then(json =\u0026gt; console.log(json)) .catch(err =\u0026gt; console.log(err)) Response ➤ {completed: true, title: \u0026quot;new todo item\u0026quot;, userId: 1, id: 201} Two things to note in above code:-\n POST request is similar to GET request. We need to additionally send the method, body and headers properties in second argument of fetch() API. We have to explicitly JSON.stringify() the request body params\n  Axios API Axios API is very similar to fetch API with few enhancements. I personally prefer to use Axios API instead of fetch() API due to following reasons:-\n Provides different methods for GET axios.get(), POST axios.post(), \u0026hellip; which makes your code concise Consider 299++ response codes such as 404, 500 as errors which can be handled in catch() block so you do not need to handle those errors explicitly It provides backward compatibility with old browsers such as IE11 It returns the response as JSON object so you do not need to do any parsing It takes the POST request body as JSON object so you do not need to do any stringify   Example: GET // way to include script in chrome console var script = document.createElement(\u0026#39;script\u0026#39;); script.type = \u0026#39;text/javascript\u0026#39;; script.src = \u0026#39;https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js\u0026#39;; document.head.appendChild(script); axios.get(\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\u0026#39;) .then(response =\u0026gt; console.log(response.data)) .catch(err =\u0026gt; console.error(err)); Response { userId: 1, id: 1, title: \u0026quot;delectus aut autem\u0026quot;, completed: false } We see that we get the response data directly using response.data without any parsing object unlike fetch() API.\n\nError Handling axios.get(\u0026#39;http://httpstat.us/500\u0026#39;) .then(response =\u0026gt; console.log(response.data)) .catch(err =\u0026gt; console.error(\u0026#34;Inside catch block:\u0026#34;, err)); ➤ Inside catch block: Error: Network Error We see that 500 error is also get caught by catch() block unlike fetch() API where we have to handle them explicitly.\n\nExample: POST axios.post(\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos\u0026#39;, { completed: true, title: \u0026#39;new todo item\u0026#39;, userId: 1 }) .then(response =\u0026gt; console.log(response.data)) .catch(err =\u0026gt; console.log(err)) ➤ {completed: true, title: \u0026quot;new todo item\u0026quot;, userId: 1, id: 201} We see that POST method is very short and concise. You can directly pass the request body parameters unlike fetch() API where we stringify them.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/how-to-make-ajax-calls-in-javascript/","tags":["Javascript Core"],"title":"How to Make AJAX Calls in JavaScript"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Builder Design Pattern is one of the commonly used design patterns. It falls under the category of Creational Design Patterns.\nOverview Analogy As the name suggests, Builder Design Pattern is used to build objects.\nMainly it is used to create complex object by using step by step approach and final step will return the object in complete state. Same construction process is used to create different representations of a complex object. This helps to make the object construction process generic.\nClass doesn\u0026rsquo;t create an object itself directly but delegates object creation to its Builder.\nNeed for Builder Design Pattern Let\u0026rsquo;s consider a case where we have entity that contains a lot of attributes.\n In case of too many parameters of a single object where some may be optional and some required. In that case we would require to create multiple constructors (constructor overloading). Or we would be forced to send NULL for optional, not required parameters. Also, in case of same types of parameters, we would need to maintain order of parameters.\nWe can solve this problem by having a constructor for required attributes and setters for optional attributes. In that case, the problem would be that we would have an intermediate state of object in between during the process of building the final object i.e. till the last required setter call. This implies we would have an inconsistent state of theobject until the expected object is fully created. Ideally the object shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be available till it is in complete state. So we would need a way to create objects in complete state i.e. without the setters. This would ensure the immutability of the final object that is built. Immutability is the key of builder design pattern.  How to implement Builder Design Pattern  Create an entity class and add all the attributes of the class. Add a static nested Builder class. Copy all the attributes from outer class to builder class. Add methods in Builder class for each attribute to set on builder object and return the same builder object i.e. each of these methods are enriching the builder object with newer attribute. These method names need not follow setter methods rules, names could be verbose. We could add little optimization here by adding the constructor in builder class for required attributes and individual methods for optional attributes. (do this optimization if you feel required attributes list would never change, otherwise not a necessary step). Final step in object creation would be to add a build method in builder class that would actually call the private constructor of outer class to create an object. For this, we would need to add a private constructor in the outer entity class that accepts Builder object to construct the final entity object. Private constructor would ensure that the object is created through this builder only. Make sure not to add any setter methods in outer class. It will defeat the purpose of creating an immutable object. Finally, we would create a client class that uses the static inner Builder class to first create its object and calls different methods to enrich the builder and in the end calls build() which actually returns the required entity object. We notice that the object creation is a chained method call where each call is returning the builder object itself though we get the final object on call of build().  Code Example Now we know what are the classes required to build a Builder Design Pattern. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the class diagram:\n   Let\u0026rsquo;s create an entity class called Employee which would help us in creating desired objects with all required attributes and combination of optional attributes ensuring immutability.\npublic class Employee { private int employeeId; //required  private String name; //required  private String phone; //optional  private String alternativePhone; //optional  private String address; //optional  //Note - only 1 private constructor to ensure all object creation goes through this  private Employee(EmployeeBuilder employeeBuilder) { this.employeeId = employeeBuilder.employeeId; this.name = employeeBuilder.name; this.phone = employeeBuilder.phone; this.alternativePhone = employeeBuilder.alternativePhone; this.address = employeeBuilder.address; } //Note - No setters (provides immutability)  // You can add getters if needed  @Override public String toString() { return \u0026#34;Employee{\u0026#34; + \u0026#34;employeeId=\u0026#34; + employeeId + \u0026#34;, name=\u0026#39;\u0026#34; + name + \u0026#39;\\\u0026#39;\u0026#39; + \u0026#34;, phone=\u0026#39;\u0026#34; + phone + \u0026#39;\\\u0026#39;\u0026#39; + \u0026#34;, alternativePhone=\u0026#39;\u0026#34; + alternativePhone + \u0026#39;\\\u0026#39;\u0026#39; + \u0026#34;, address=\u0026#39;\u0026#34; + address + \u0026#39;\\\u0026#39;\u0026#39; + \u0026#39;}\u0026#39;; } public static class EmployeeBuilder { private int employeeId; private String name; private String phone; private String alternativePhone; private String address; public EmployeeBuilder(int employeeId, String name) { this.employeeId = employeeId; this.name = name; } public EmployeeBuilder withPhone(String phone) { this.phone = phone; return this; } public EmployeeBuilder withAlternativePhone(String alternativePhone) { this.alternativePhone = alternativePhone; return this; } public EmployeeBuilder withAddress(String address) { this.address = address; return this; } public Employee build() { Employee employee = new Employee(this); return employee; } } }   Let\u0026rsquo;s create a client (Main Class) to test object creation through Builder Design Pattern\npublic class Client { public static void main(String[] args) { //Object with all the attributes  Employee employee1 = new Employee.EmployeeBuilder(112, \u0026#34;Ria Gupta\u0026#34;) .withPhone(\u0026#34;9876543210\u0026#34;) .withAlternativePhone(\u0026#34;9988776655\u0026#34;) .withAddress(\u0026#34;413-3rd Avenue, Shantinagar, Bangalore\u0026#34;) .build(); System.out.println(employee1); //Object with a combination of required and some optional attributes  Employee employee2 = new Employee.EmployeeBuilder(113, \u0026#34;Rishabh Goyal\u0026#34;) .withPhone(\u0026#34;1234567890\u0026#34;) // no alternative phone  // no address  .build(); System.out.println(employee2); //Object with only required attributes  Employee employee3 = new Employee.EmployeeBuilder(114, \u0026#34;Abhishek Bansal\u0026#34;) //no phone  //no alternative phone no  // address  .build(); System.out.println(employee3); } } Output\rEmployee{employeeId=112, name='Ria Gupta', phone='9876543210', alternativePhone='9988776655', address='413-3rd Avenue, Shantinagar, Banglore'}\rEmployee{employeeId=113, name='Rishabh Goyal', phone='1234567890', alternativePhone='null', address='null'}\rEmployee{employeeId=114, name='Abhishek Bansal', phone='null', alternativePhone='null', address='null'}\r  Advantages of Builder Design Pattern  Reduction in multiple constructors. Only one constructor that accepts Builder object is required. There is no need to pass null for optional parameters to the constructor. Object is instantiated fully i.e. in a complete state. We always get an immutable object since we didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any setter methods and hence state of object once created cannot be changed. Lesser error prone as user would know what they are passing in each method call. This also gives design flexibility and more readable of client code.  Disadvantages of Builder Design Pattern  The number of lines of code gets at least double using builder pattern as we copy all the fields of entity class to builder class. Code becomes more verbose. It requires the creation of a separate builder for each type of object.  Conclusion In this article, we saw that Builder Design Pattern is a rescue where our use-case is such that we have a lot of parameters for a particular object type or we have requirement of adding new parameters may be in future. This should be used when we want to build immutable objects using theme construction process.\nIn addition to the benefits said above, opt for this pattern makes adding parameters easier and code becomes less error-prone and easy to read.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/java/builder-design-pattern-java/","tags":["Java Design Pattern"],"title":"Builder Design Pattern In Java"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hi Travellers,\nThough this is a technical blog, I thought of helping people, who are willing to travel from Singapore to India under VBM (Vande Bharat Mission).\nHere is the list of frequently asked questions\u0026hellip;\n*(Please comment if you find something to be corrected, or added in this post.

In this post, We\u0026rsquo;ll see that how we can associate an author with each article. We\u0026rsquo;ll also see how we to show author name, a short description about author on each article.\nSupport for Multiple Authors Follow these steps to enable the multiple author support for your Hugo Website:\nCreate a Data file for Each Author In Hugo project structure, there should a data directory at root level, create one if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nHugo provides the ability to access the files and their content in data directory, which we are going to use to fetch author\u0026rsquo;s details. From an organizational perspective, it is recommended to structure our directory as the following:\n▾ data ▾ authors ashishlahoti.json bobmarley.json charliechaplin.json davidbeckham.json ... Notice that we have created a JSON file for each individual author in data/authors directory. The naming convention doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter but it is recommended to use first name followed by last name for consistency.\nEach individual author JSON file for e.g. data/authors/ashishlahoti.json looks something like this:\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Ashish Lahoti\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bio\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Ashish Lahoti has experience in full stack technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;avatar\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/media/authors/ashishlahoti.png\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;social\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;linkedin\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/lahotiashish\u0026quot; } } It is not necessary that you should follow the same JSON structure and use the same fields but it is recommended that whatever fields you add should be consistent across all your authors JSON files.\nNow that we have details of all the authors in data files, let\u0026rsquo;s use them.\nUse \u0026ldquo;author\u0026rdquo; in front-matter In Hugo, We generally write an article in markdown (.md) file and add metadata about the article in front-matter. A typical front-matter of an article looks like this:\n--- title: Multiple Authors Support in Hugo Website description: Understand how to manage multiple authors in Hugo Website date: 2020-07-26 author: ashishlahoti categories: - \u0026quot;Hugo\u0026quot; tags: - \u0026quot;authors\u0026quot; - \u0026quot;blogging\u0026quot; - \u0026quot;template\u0026quot; - \u0026quot;data\u0026quot; images: - \u0026quot;/img/logo/gohugo.png\u0026quot; --- In the above example, notice the author field and its value we\u0026rsquo;ve set. The value of the author field should match the author\u0026rsquo;s file name in data/authors directory. This is very important as we are going to get the author details from this file matching with author field value.\nDefault Author We\u0026rsquo;re also going to create a default author for the articles in case \u0026ldquo;author\u0026rdquo; is not provided in the front-matter for simplicity. Default author will be used as a fallback. We can create a data/authors/default.json file in data directory.\n▾ data ▾ authors default.json ... Example of the default.json file:\n{ \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;CodingNConcepts\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bio\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;CodingNConcepts is a technical blog for developers from developers\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;avatar\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/media/authors/codingnconcepts.png\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;social\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;linkedin\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/codingnconcepts/\u0026quot; } } \nDisplay Author Details in Generated Hugo Pages This is the interesting part. We can include the conditions like this to add author details:\n{{ $author := index .Site.Data.authors (.Params.author | default \u0026quot;default\u0026quot;) }} {{- if $author -}} {{ $author.name }} {{- end -}} Note that -\n .Site.Data.authors is used to fetch data from the data/authors directory .Params.author is used to get the value of the author from front-matter of the article | default \u0026quot;default\u0026quot; is used as a fallback in case author is not provided in the front-matter of the article $author.name will get the name field value from that particular author JSON file  \nPractical Usage You can create a partial author to show author name in Hugo pages like this:\nlayouts/partials/author.html {{ $author := index .Site.Data.authors (.Params.author | default \u0026quot;ashishlahoti\u0026quot;) }} {{- if $author -}} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;meta_item\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ partial \u0026quot;svg/author.svg\u0026quot; (dict \u0026quot;class\u0026quot; \u0026quot;meta_icon\u0026quot;) -}} \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;meta_text\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ $author.name }}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{- end -}} The Author svg icon used as below:\nlayouts/partials/svg/author.svg \u0026lt;svg class=\u0026quot;{{ with .class }}{{ . }} {{ end }}icon icon-author\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;16\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;16\u0026quot; viewBox=\u0026quot;0 0 12 16\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;path d=\u0026quot;M6 1c2.2 0 3.5 2 3.5 4.5C9.5 7 8.9 8.2 8 9c2.9.8 4 2.5 4 5v1H0v-1c0-2.5 1.1-4.2 4-5-.9-.8-1.5-2-1.5-3.5C2.5 3 3.8 1 6 1z\u0026quot;/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt; You can also create a partial authorbox to show author details at the end of the page like this:\nlayouts/partials/authorbox.html {{- if .Param \u0026quot;authorbox\u0026quot; }} {{- $author := index .Site.Data.authors (.Params.author | default .Site.Author.code) -}} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;authorbox\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{- with $author.avatar }} \u0026lt;figure class=\u0026quot;authorbox__avatar\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img alt=\u0026quot;{{ $author.name }} avatar\u0026quot; src=\u0026quot;{{ $author.avatar | relURL }}\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;avatar\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;90\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;90\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/figure\u0026gt; {{- end }} {{- with $author.name }} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;authorbox__header\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;authorbox__name\u0026quot;\u0026gt;About {{ . }}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{- end }} {{- with $author.bio }} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;authorbox__description\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ . }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{- end }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{- end }} Show List of Articles of Individual Author Once you enable multiple author support for your Hugo Website. Next requirement comes where you want to display list of articles of individual author. Follow these steps:\nDefine an \u0026ldquo;author\u0026rdquo; taxonomy Define an \u0026ldquo;author\u0026rdquo; taxonomy similar to tag and category in your Hugo configuration file.\nconfig.toml [taxonomies] tag = \u0026quot;tags\u0026quot; category = \u0026quot;categories\u0026quot;  author = \u0026#34;authors\u0026#34; \nAdd \u0026ldquo;authors\u0026rdquo; field in front-matter Add the \u0026ldquo;authors\u0026rdquo; field in the front-matter of the article similar to tags and categories. Note that you can associate multiple authors in \u0026ldquo;authors\u0026rdquo; field just like you can have multiple tags and categories.\n--- title: Multiple Authors Support in Hugo Website description: Understand how to manage multiple authors in Hugo Website date: 2020-07-26 author: ashishlahoti categories: - \u0026quot;Hugo\u0026quot; tags: - \u0026quot;authors\u0026quot; - \u0026quot;blogging\u0026quot; - \u0026quot;template\u0026quot; - \u0026quot;data\u0026quot; images: - \u0026quot;/img/logo/gohugo.png\u0026quot; authors:  - ashishlahoti --- If multiple authors have contributed to an article then \u0026ldquo;author\u0026rdquo; field can have primary author and \u0026ldquo;authors\u0026rdquo; field can have all the authors including primary author.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s it. You should be able to access the list of articles of a particular author using similar url:\nhttp://localhost:1313/authors/ashishlahoti/ Also list of all the authors would be accessible using this url:\nhttp://localhost:1313/authors/ Conclusion We saw that how we can manage multiple author details in their individual JSON files and how we can fetch the details from those files to display author name, bio (short description), avatar and social media contact details etc. We\u0026rsquo;ve also seen how we can show the list of articles of individual author.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/hugo/multiple-authors-hugo/","tags":["Hugo"],"title":"Multiple Authors Support in Hugo Website"},{"categories":["Hugo"],"contents":"In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to generate auto-numbering for headings, subheadings, and TOC in Hugo Pages.\nOverview When you generate a website using Hugo static site generator, It doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide any out of the box auto-numbering support for headings, subheadings, and TOC in Hugo Pages.\nThis blog website is also generated using Hugo and with few changes, we\u0026rsquo;re able to add auto-numbering support to our Hugo Pages.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re still not clear what is auto-numbering all about then look at the auto incrementing numbers before the headings, subheadings and TOC in this post i.e. 1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 etc.\n1.

Hugo auto generates different kind of pages for you which are generally required for a website.\nRefer this table for kind of pages Hugo support:\n   Kind Description Example     home Home page of your website /   section Section pages, which list all the pages rendered from a subdirectory in our content folder. /posts   page Individual blog post pages /posts/my-post/   taxonomy Taxonomy e.g. Tags pages, which list all the tags of the website. /tags   term Term pages e.g. \u0026ldquo;trending\u0026rdquo; tag, which list all the pages using this particular tag /tags/trending   RSS RSS Feeds index.xml   sitemap Sitemap of your website used for indexing pages of you website by search engines sitemap.xml   404 404 error page used when any URL not found in your website /unknownurl    All these kind of pages are good to have for your website but sometime they are not required for a basic website.\nDisable Pages Good news is that you can disable any kind of page from the configuration using disableKinds which takes comma separated values. Possible values are: “page”, “home”, “section”, “taxonomy”, “term”, “RSS”, “sitemap”, “robotsTXT”, “404”.\nDisable Pages using config.toml This approach is recommended, when you want to disable pages permanently everytime you build your website.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s disable all the auto generated pages permanently by giving comma separated values in disableKinds configuration.\nconfig.toml title = \u0026quot;Hugo example site\u0026quot; baseurl = \u0026quot;https://www.example.com\u0026quot; disableKinds = [\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;home\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;section\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;taxonomy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;term\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;RSS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sitemap\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;robotsTXT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;404\u0026#34;] [taxonomies] category = \u0026quot;categories\u0026quot; tag = \u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;  You can also prevent a specific page from generation by Hugo as follows:\n  RSS Feed Hugo auto generate RSS Feed using built-in RSS 2.0 template for whole website, for each section, for each taxonomy term and for each taxonomy value pages.

We\u0026rsquo;ll also learn about built-in JavaScript error objects (Error, SyntaxError, ReferenceError, etc.) and how to define custom errors.\nUsing try..catch..finally..throw We use try, catch, finally and throw keywords in error handling in JavaScript.\n The try block wrap your code to check for errors. The throw keyword is used to throw custom errors. The catch block handle the caught errors. You chain catch block with try block. The finally block of code is always executed regardless of the result. You chain finally block with try and catch block.\n  try Every try block must be chained with at least one of the catch or finally block otherwise SyntaxError will be thrown.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s use try block alone to verify:\ntry { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Error while executing the code\u0026#39;); } ⓧ Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing catch or finally after try \ntry..catch It is recommended to use try with catch block which handles the error gracefully thrown by try block.\ntry { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Error while executing the code\u0026#39;); } catch (err) { console.error(err.message); } ➤ ⓧ Error while executing the code try..catch with invalid code The try..catch cannot catch the exception of invalid JavaScript code, for example the below code in try block is syntactically wrong and cannot be caught by catch block.\ntry { ~!$%^\u0026amp;* } catch(err) { console.log(\u0026#34;code execution will never reach here\u0026#34;); } ➤ ⓧ Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token try..catch with asynchronous code Similarly try..catch cannot catch the exception thrown inside asynchronous code which will be executed later such as setTimeout\ntry { setTimeout(function() { noSuchVariable; // undefined variable  }, 1000); } catch (err) { console.log(\u0026#34;code execution will never reach here\u0026#34;); } Uncaught ReferenceError will be thrown after 1s\n➤ ⓧ Uncaught ReferenceError: noSuchVariable is not definedn We should use try..catch inside asynchronous code to handle the error gracefully in this way\nsetTimeout(function() { try { noSuchVariable; } catch(err) { console.log(\u0026#34;error is caught here!\u0026#34;); } }, 1000); Nested try..catch We can also use nested try and catch blocks and throw an error upwards like this:\ntry { try { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Error while executing the inner code\u0026#39;); } catch (err) { throw err; } } catch (err) { console.log(\u0026#34;Error caught by outer block:\u0026#34;); console.error(err.message); } Error caught by outer block: ➤ ⓧ Error while executing the code \ntry..finally It is not recommended to use try with finally (without using catch block in between). Let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens:\ntry { throw new Error(\u0026#39;Error while executing the code\u0026#39;); } finally { console.log(\u0026#39;finally\u0026#39;); } finally ➤ ⓧ Uncaught Error: Error while executing the code We should note two things here:\n The finally block is executed even after error is thrown from try block Error is not handled gracefully without catch block resulting in Uncaught Error  \ntry..catch..finally It is recommended to use try with catch block and optional finally block.\ntry { console.log(\u0026#34;Start of try block\u0026#34;); throw new Error(\u0026#39;Error while executing the code\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#34;End of try block -- never reached\u0026#34;); } catch (err) { console.error(err.message); } finally { console.log(\u0026#39;Finally block always run\u0026#39;); } console.log(\u0026#34;Code execution outside try-catch-finally block continue..\u0026#34;); Start of try block ➤ ⓧ Error while executing the code Finally block always run Code execution outside try-catch-finally block continue.. We should note two things here as well:\n The code after throwing error in try block never reached. Error is handled gracefully this time by catch block. The finally block is executed even after error is thrown from try block.  The finally block is generally used for cleaning up resources or closing the streams such as below:\ntry { openFile(file); readFile(file); } catch (err) { console.error(err.message); } finally { closeFile(file); } \nthrow The throw statement is used to throw an exception.\nthrow \u0026lt;expression\u0026gt; // throw primitives and functions throw \u0026#34;Error404\u0026#34;; throw 42; throw true; throw {toString: function() { return \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m an object!\u0026#34;; } }; // throw error object throw new Error(\u0026#39;Error while executing the code\u0026#39;); throw new SyntaxError(\u0026#39;Something is wrong with the syntax\u0026#39;); throw new ReferenceError(\u0026#39;Oops..Wrong reference\u0026#39;); // throw custom error object function ValidationError(message) { this.message = message; this.name = \u0026#39;ValidationError\u0026#39;; } throw new ValidationError(\u0026#39;Value too high\u0026#39;); Error handling in asynchronous Code It is recommended to use Promises and async await for asynchronous code (API calls) as they provide support for error handling.\nthen..catch with Promises You can chain multiple Promises using then() along with catch() to handle errors of individual promise in the chain like this:\nPromise.resolve(1) .then(res =\u0026gt; { console.log(res); // prints \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;  throw new Error(\u0026#39;something went wrong\u0026#39;); // throw error  return Promise.resolve(2); // code will not reach here  }) .then(res =\u0026gt; { // code will not reach since promise not resolved in prev block here due to error  console.log(res); }) .catch(err =\u0026gt; { console.error(err.message); // prints \u0026#39;something went wrong\u0026#39;  return Promise.resolve(3); }) .then(res =\u0026gt; { console.log(res); // prints \u0026#39;3\u0026#39;  }) .catch(err =\u0026gt; { // code will not reach since promise resolved in prev block  console.error(err); }) Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the more practical example where we call an API using fetch which returns a promise object. We handle the API failure gracefully using catch block.\nfunction handleErrors(response) { if (!response.ok) { throw Error(response.statusText); } return response; } fetch(\u0026#34;http://httpstat.us/500\u0026#34;) .then(handleErrors) .then(response =\u0026gt; console.log(\u0026#34;ok\u0026#34;)) .catch(error =\u0026gt; console.log(\u0026#34;Caught\u0026#34;, error)); Caught Error: Internal Server Error at handleErrors (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:3:15) \ntry..catch with async await It is very easy to handle errors using try..catch when handling asynchronous with async await like this:\n(async function() { try { await fetch(\u0026#34;http://httpstat.us/500\u0026#34;); } catch (err) { console.error(err.message); } })(); Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the same example where we call an API using fetch which returns a promise object. We handle the API failure gracefully using try..catch block.\nfunction handleErrors(response) { if (!response.ok) { throw Error(response.statusText); } } (async function() { try { let response = await fetch(\u0026#34;http://httpstat.us/500\u0026#34;); handleErrors(response); let data = await response.json(); return data; } catch (error) { console.log(\u0026#34;Caught\u0026#34;, error) } })(); Caught Error: Internal Server Error at handleErrors (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:3:15) at \u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:11:7 Built-In JavaScript Errors Error JavaScript has built-in Error Object which is generally thrown by try block and caught in catch block.\nError Object consist of following properties:\n name: is the name of the error for e.g. \u0026ldquo;Error\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;SyntaxError\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;ReferenceError\u0026rdquo; etc. message: is the message about error details stack: is the stack trace of the error used for debugging purpose.  Let\u0026rsquo;s create an Error Object and look at its name and message property:\nconst err = new Error(\u0026#39;Error while executing the code\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#34;name:\u0026#34;, err.name); console.log(\u0026#34;message:\u0026#34;, err.message); console.log(\u0026#34;stack:\u0026#34;, err.stack); name: Error message: Error while executing the code stack: Error: Error while executing the code at \u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:1:13 JavaScript has following built-in errors which are inherited from the Error Object:\nEvalError The EvalError indicates an error regarding the global eval() function. This exception is not thrown by JavaScript anymore and it exist for backward compatibility.\nRangeError The RangeError is thrown when a value out of range.\n➤ [].length = -1 ⓧ Uncaught RangeError: Invalid array length ReferenceError The ReferenceError is thrown when a variable is referenced which does not exist.\n➤ x = x + 1; ⓧ Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined SyntaxError The SyntaxError is thrown when you have used any wrong syntax in JavaScript code.\n➤ function() { return 'Hi!' } ⓧ Uncaught SyntaxError: Function statements require a function name ➤ 1 = 1 ⓧ Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment ➤ JSON.parse(\u0026quot;{ x }\u0026quot;);

ⓧ Uncaught URIError: URI malformed Define and throw Custom Error We can also define our custom error in this way:\nclass CustomError extends Error { constructor(message) { super(message); this.name = \u0026#34;CustomError\u0026#34;; } }; const err = new CustomError(\u0026#39;Custom error while executing the code\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#34;name:\u0026#34;, err.name); console.log(\u0026#34;message:\u0026#34;, err.message); name: CustomError message: Custom error while executing the code We can further enhance our CustomError object to include error code as well:\nclass CustomError extends Error { constructor(message, code) { super(message);

Default font-size is 16px, which user can always change according to their preference as below:\n Font Size Setting in Chrome Browser\n  You can override the default font-size setting of the browser using CSS in this way:\nhtml { font-size: 32px; } or\nhtml { font-size: 200%; } Though it is not recommended to override default behavior of the browser otherwise it won\u0026rsquo;t honor user preference which is not a good idea.\nPX  The pixel px is an absolute and fixed-size unit in CSS.\n Pixels are easily translatable. For example using below CSS, font-size of p (paragraph) element will always remain 12px on all devices and screens regardless of changing the browser font-size setting, or any of its parent element\u0026rsquo;s font-size.\np { font-size: 12px; } Although the size of a pixel isn’t always the same across devices and screens, means the actual width of the block having width: 120px on laptop is not same as on iPad.\nWhat is the problem with px? The problem arises, when user changes the default font-size of the browser say they want to see bigger font-size. In that case p (paragraph) element with above CSS will still be displayed as font-size: 12px since its an absolute value. User preference is not reflected which is not considered as a good user experience.\nWhen to use px? Pixel px is still a good choice for fixed layout measurement and fixed spacing (padding, margin, etc.) but not a good choice for flexible layouts and font-size measurement.\nAlternate of px? The em and rem are the relative (or flexible) units as oppose to px, which is an absolute (or fixed) unit. Both em and rem are translated by the browser into pixel (px) values, depending on the default font-size setting of the browser. Say, if browser\u0026rsquo;s default font-size is 16px, then\n1em = 16px; 1rem = 16px; EM  The em unit is relative to its direct or nearest parent element.\n If font-size is not defined explicitly, that element will inherit it from the parent element. The inheritance continues to take place this way amongst ancestors up until the root element. Default font-size of the root element is provided by browser.\nWhen to use em? 1. Nested Structure\nWe can use the em where you want to apply font-size relative to the parent element such as menu structure.\n\u0026lt;style\u0026gt; .menu-container { font-size: 100px;  border: 1px solid black; } .menu-item { font-size: 0.5em;  padding-left: 20px; } .menu-item::before { content: \u0026#39;▾\u0026#39; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;container\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;menu-container\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;menu\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;menu-item\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Menu \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;submenu\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;menu-item\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Submenu \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;subsubmenu\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;menu-item\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Subsubmenu \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;another_subsubmenu\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Another Subsubmenu \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;  .menu-container { font-size: 100px; border: 1px solid black; } .menu-item { font-size: 0.5em; padding-left: 20px; } .menu-item::before { content: '▾' }  Menu Submenu Subsubmenu  Another Subsubmenu     We see that font-size is reducing as we go to the nested levels of menu structure even though we have applied the same CSS class .menu-item to all nested menu items. Let\u0026rsquo;s break down how browser is calculating the the pixel (px) from rem relative values.\n The #menu item font-size: 0.5em is relative to the #container so font-size in pixel would be 100x0.5 = 50px The #submenu item font-size: 0.5em is relative to the #menu so font-size in pixel would be 50x0.5 = 25px The #subsubmenu item font-size: 0.5em is relative to the #submenu so font-size in pixel would be 25x0.5 = 12.5px The #another_subsubmenu item class and font-size is not defined so font-size in pixel would be same as its parent #submenu i.e. 25px  2. Media Queries\nThe em should be used to define screen width in media queries. Here is an interesting post which explains why em should be used for media queries.\nWhat is the problem with em? The main problem with em is that you need to do all mathematical calculation of font-size of child elements as we did. Moreover, if you want to apply a specific font-size to child element, you cannot do that using em.\nAlternate of em? The rem is the solution of our problem. It is a relative unit and not dependent on parent elements. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at it.\nREM  The rem unit is relative to the html (root) element.\n If the font-size of root html element is 16px i.e.\n:root { font-size: 16px; } then\n1rem = 16px for all the elements.\nIf font-size is not explicitly defined in root element then 1rem will be equal to the default font-size provided by the browser (usually 16px).\nWhen to use rem? It is recommended to use rem for spacing (margin, padding, etc.) and font size in CSS as it honors user\u0026rsquo;s preferences and provide better user experience.\npx to rem when root is 16px you can use the following table to convert from px to rem when root font-size is 16px:\n   px rem     10px 0.625rem   11px 0.6875rem   12px 0.75rem   13px 0.8125rem   14px 0.875rem   15px 0.9375rem   16px 1rem   17px 1.0625rem   18px 1.125rem   19px 1.1875rem   20px 1.25rem   21px 1.3125rem   22px 1.375rem   23px 1.4375rem   24px 1.5rem   25px 1.5625rem   26px 1.625rem   27px 1.6875rem   28px 1.75rem   29px 1.8125rem   30px 1.875rem   31px 1.9375rem   32px 2rem   33px 2.0625rem   34px 2.125rem   35px 2.1875rem   36px 2.25rem   37px 2.3125rem   38px 2.375rem   39px 2.4375rem   40px 2.5rem   41px 2.5625rem   42px 2.625rem   43px 2.6875rem   44px 2.75rem   45px 2.8125rem   46px 2.875rem   47px 2.9375rem   48px 3rem   49px 3.0625rem   50px 3.125rem   51px 3.1875rem   52px 3.25rem   53px 3.3125rem   54px 3.375rem   55px 3.4375rem   56px 3.5rem   57px 3.5625rem   58px 3.625rem   59px 3.6875rem   60px 3.75rem   61px 3.8125rem   62px 3.875rem   63px 3.9375rem   64px 4rem     You can also calculate rem using Pixel to Rem Converter\n Final Thoughts The best practice for the web developers is to:\n Use px for fixed size layout (width, height, etc.) or fixed spacing (margin, padding, etc.) Use em for nested elements (tree, menu, etc.) and media queries Use rem for flexible layout, spacing, and font-size ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/css/font-size-units-px-em-and-rem/","tags":["CSS Font-Size"],"title":"CSS units for font-size: px, em and rem"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll see the difference between Array.forEach() and Array.map() methods in JavaScript Array.\nThe forEach() and map() method are mostly used to iterate through an Array elements but there are few differences, We\u0026rsquo;ll look at them one by one.\nReturned Value The forEach() method returns undefined whereas map() returns a new array with transformed elements.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s find out the square of each element in an Array using these two methods:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // using forEach() const squareUsingForEach = []; numbers.forEach(x =\u0026gt; squareUsingForEach.push(x*x)); // using map() const squareUsingMap = numbers.map(x =\u0026gt; x*x); console.log(squareUsingForEach); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] console.log(squareUsingMap); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] Since forEach() returns undefined, we need to pass an empty array to create a new transformed array. There is no such issue with map() method which returns the new transformed array directly. It is recommended to use map() method in such cases.\nChaining other methods The map() method output can be chained with other methods such as reduce(), sort(), filter() to perform multiple operations in a single statement.\nOn the other hand, forEach() is a terminal method means it cannot be chained with other methods since it returns undefined.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s find out the sum of square of each element in an Array using these two methods:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // using forEach() const squareUsingForEach = [] let sumOfSquareUsingForEach = 0; numbers.forEach(x =\u0026gt; squareUsingForEach.push(x*x)); squareUsingForEach.forEach(square =\u0026gt; sumOfSquareUsingForEach += square); // using map() const sumOfSquareUsingMap = numbers.map(x =\u0026gt; x*x).reduce((total, value) =\u0026gt; total + value); console.log(sumOfSquareUsingForEach); // 55 console.log(sumOfSquareUsingMap); // 55 It is such a tedious job to use forEach() method when multiple operations are required. We can use map() method in such cases.\nPerformance We have created an array with 1 million random numbers (ranging from 1 to 1000). Let\u0026rsquo;s check the performance of each method.\n// Array: var numbers = []; for ( var i = 0; i \u0026lt; 1000000; i++ ) { numbers.push(Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1)); } // 1. forEach() console.time(\u0026#34;forEach\u0026#34;); const squareUsingForEach = []; numbers.forEach(x =\u0026gt; squareUsingForEach.push(x*x)); console.timeEnd(\u0026#34;forEach\u0026#34;); // 2. map() console.time(\u0026#34;map\u0026#34;); const squareUsingMap = numbers.map(x =\u0026gt; x*x); console.timeEnd(\u0026#34;map\u0026#34;); Here is the result after running the above code on MacBook Pro\u0026rsquo;s Google Chrome v83.0.4103.106 (64-bit). I suggest to copy the above code and try yourself in console.\nforEach: 26.596923828125ms map: 21.97998046875ms Clearly map() method performs better then forEach() for transforming elements.\nBreak the iteration This is not the difference between these two methods but important to know that there is no way to stop or break; the iteration if you are using forEach() or map() methods. The only way is to throw an exception from the callback function which may not be desired in most of the cases.\nIf we use break; statement within the callback function of forEach() or map() method,\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // break; inside forEach() const squareUsingForEach = []; numbers.forEach(x =\u0026gt; { if(x == 3) break; // \u0026lt;- SyntaxError  squareUsingForEach.push(x*x); }); // break; inside map() const squareUsingMap = numbers.map(x =\u0026gt; { if(x == 3) break; // \u0026lt;- SyntaxError  return x*x; }); JavaScript throws SyntaxError as follows:\nⓧ Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal break statement If you need such behavior then you should use simple for loop or for-of / for-in loop.\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; // break; inside for-of loop const squareUsingForEach = []; for(x of numbers){ if(x == 3) break; squareUsingForEach.push(x*x); }; console.log(squareUsingForEach); // [1, 4] Final Thoughts It is recommended to use map() to transform elements of an array since it is having short syntax, it\u0026rsquo;s chainable and has better performance.\nYou shouldn\u0026rsquo;t use map() if you\u0026rsquo;re not using returned array or not transforming elements of an array. It\u0026rsquo;s an anti-pattern; instead you should use forEach() method.\nAt last, if you want to stop or break the iteration of an array based on some condition then you should use simple for loop or for-of / for-in loop.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/difference-between-foreach-and-map-in-javascript-array/","tags":["Javascript Array"],"title":"Difference Between forEach() and map() in JavaScript Array"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to divide an Array in equal parts using Array.splice() method in JavaScript. We will also learn how it is different from Array.slice() method.\nDivide array in two equal parts We can divide an array in half in two steps:\n Find the middle index of the array using length/2 and Math.ceil() method, Get two equal parts of the array using this middle index and Array.splice() method  const list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; const middleIndex = Math.ceil(list.length / 2); const firstHalf = list.splice(0, middleIndex); const secondHalf = list.splice(-middleIndex); console.log(firstHalf); // [1, 2, 3] console.log(secondHalf); // [4, 5, 6] console.log(list); // []  Array.splice() method changes the content of an array by removing, replacing or adding elements. Do not confuse this method with Array.slice() method which is used to make a copy of an array.\n  list.splice(0, middleIndex) removes first 3 elements starting from 0 index from an array and returns it. list.splice(-middleIndex) removes last 3 elements from an array and returns it.  At the end of these two operations, since we have removed all the elements from the array, the original array is empty.\nAlso note that number of elements are even in the above case, in case of odd number of elements, first half will have one extra element.\nconst list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const middleIndex = Math.ceil(list.length / 2); list.splice(0, middleIndex); // returns [1, 2, 3] list.splice(-middleIndex); // returns [4, 5] Array.slice and Array.splice Sometime you wish not to alter the original array, this can also be done by chaining Array.slice() method with Array.splice()\nconst list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; const middleIndex = Math.ceil(list.length / 2); const firstHalf = list.slice().splice(0, middleIndex); const secondHalf = list.slice().splice(-middleIndex); console.log(firstHalf); // [1, 2, 3] console.log(secondHalf); // [4, 5, 6] console.log(list); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; We see that our original array remains the same since we make a copy of original array using Array.slice() before removing the elements using Array.splice().\nDivide array in three equal parts Let\u0026rsquo;s define an array and divide them in three equal parts using the Array.splice method.\nconst list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; const threePartIndex = Math.ceil(list.length / 3); const thirdPart = list.splice(-threePartIndex); const secondPart = list.splice(-threePartIndex); const firstPart = list; console.log(firstPart); // [1, 2, 3] console.log(secondPart); // [4, 5, 6] console.log(thirdPart); // [7, 8, 9] Let\u0026rsquo;s break down how it happened:\n We have first extracted the thirdPart using list.splice(-threePartIndex), which removes last 3 elements [7, 8, 9], at this point list contain only first 6 elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Now we have extracted the secondPart using list.splice(-threePartIndex), which removes last 3 elements from remaining list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] which is [4, 5, 6], at this point list contain only first 3 elements [1, 2, 3] which is firstPart.

You can omit the use of Array.slice() if you want to alter the original array in below examples.\n// Define an array const list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];  Get first element of an array list.slice().splice(0, 1); // [1]  Get first five elements of an array list.slice().splice(0, 5); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  Get all elements after first five element of an array list.slice().splice(5); // [6, 7, 8, 9]  Get last element of an array list.slice().splice(-1); // [9]  Get last three elements of an array list.slice().splice(-3); // [7, 8, 9]  ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/how-to-divide-array-in-equal-parts-in-javascript/","tags":["Javascript Array"],"title":"How to Divide an Array in Equal Parts in JavaScript"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to replace all occurrences of a string in JavaScript using String.replace() method.

Sometime you need a support for nested menu structure which is not readily available with Hugo.\nYou can follow these steps to support nested menu structure:-\n Update config.toml file to provide menu and submenu configuration. Create layouts/partials/menu.html to generate HTML from menu and submenu configuration. Use menu partial in either layouts/partials/header.html or layouts/_defaults/baseof.html depending upon the theme you are using. Finally you need to update your style.css file with menu related CSS  Follow the steps:- Update config.toml Let\u0026rsquo;s update config.toml with menu and submenu configuration to generate a nested menu structure like this:\n config.toml ... [menu] [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026quot;home\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;Home\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; weight = 1 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026quot;category\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;Category\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/category\u0026quot; weight = 2 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026quot;category1\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;Category1\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/tags/category1\u0026quot; parent = \u0026quot;category\u0026quot; weight = 1 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026quot;category2\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;Category2\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/tags/category2\u0026quot; parent = \u0026quot;category\u0026quot; weight = 2 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026quot;category3\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;Category3\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/tags/category3\u0026quot; parent = \u0026quot;category\u0026quot; weight = 3 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026quot;another-category\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;Another Category\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/another-category\u0026quot; weight = 3 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026quot;another-category1\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;Another Category1\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/tags/another-category1\u0026quot; parent = \u0026quot;another-category\u0026quot; weight = 1 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026quot;another-category2\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;Another Category2\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/tags/another-category2\u0026quot; parent = \u0026quot;another-category\u0026quot; weight = 2 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026quot;about\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;About Us\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/about/\u0026quot; weight = 4 You should understand each field under [[menu.main]]:\n identifier should be unique name of menu within the menu structure. It is used to identify menu, submenu and their relation by hugo internally. name should be the name which you want to display on the menu item. url is a relative URL which will be opened when you click on the menu item. weight is for sequencing the menu items. Menu items with less weight appear first in the menu. Same is applicable for submenu, submenu items with less weight appear first in the dropdown. parent is used in submenu item only to tell who is the parent of the submenu. You use the identifier of the parent menu in this field.  \nCreate layouts/partials/menu.html Now we are going to use menu and submenu configuration from config.toml file to create our menu.html partial as below:\nlayouts/partials/menu.html This is the basic menu.html if you want create your own menu from scratch.\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026quot;nav\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul class=\u0026quot;menu\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ range .Site.Menus.main }} \u0026lt;li class=\u0026quot;{{ if $currentPage.HasMenuCurrent \u0026quot;main\u0026quot; . }}active{{ end }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span\u0026gt;{{ .Name }}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{ if .HasChildren }} \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;drop-icon\u0026quot; for=\u0026quot;{{ .Name }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;▾\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul class=\u0026quot;sub-menu\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ range .Children }} \u0026lt;li class=\u0026quot;{{ if $currentPage.HasMenuCurrent \u0026quot;main\u0026quot; . }}active{{ end }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span\u0026gt;{{ .Name }}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; This is the menu.html of my blog website created using Hugo Mainroad Theme.\n{{- if .Site.Menus.main }} \u0026lt;nav class=\u0026quot;menu\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button class=\u0026quot;menu__btn\u0026quot; aria-haspopup=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; aria-expanded=\u0026quot;false\u0026quot; tabindex=\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;menu__btn-title\u0026quot; tabindex=\u0026quot;-1\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ T \u0026quot;menu_label\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul class=\u0026quot;menu__list\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{- $currentNode := . }} {{- range .Site.Menus.main }} {{- if .Name }} {{- if .HasChildren }} \u0026lt;li class=\u0026quot;menu__item menu__dropdown{{ if or ($currentNode.IsMenuCurrent \u0026quot;main\u0026quot; .)

In that case just update the existing menu.html partial. Things to note in the above partial is use of {{- if .HasChildren }} condition to check if menu has submenu children or not. If it is having submenu children, then we loop them through using {{ range .Children }}\nAlso note that you might need to add classes to the HTML elements as per the theme you are using.\nUse layouts/partials/menu.html You do not need to worry about this step if the theme which you are using already have menu.html partial, otherwise use this partial in either layouts/partials/header.html or layouts/defaults/baseof.html depending upon the theme you are using.\nUpdate your CSS This is the most important part of nested menu structure. I struggled a lot to create the right CSS for above menu.html partial. Here is relevant part of the CSS which you need to add in your existing CSS for nested menu structure to work.\nstatic/css/style.css /* Main menu */ .no-js .menu__btn { display: none; } .menu__btn { display: block; width: 100%; padding: 0; font: inherit; color: #fff; background: #2a2a2a; border: 0; outline: 0; } .menu__btn-title { position: relative; display: block; padding: 10px 15px; padding: 0.625rem 0.9375rem; font-weight: 700; text-align: right; text-transform: uppercase; cursor: pointer; -webkit-user-select: none; -moz-user-select: none; -ms-user-select: none; -o-user-select: none; user-select: none; } :focus \u0026gt; .menu__btn-title { box-shadow: inset 0 0 1px 3px #e22d30; } button:not(:-moz-focusring):focus \u0026gt; .menu__btn-title { box-shadow: none; } .menu__btn:focus, .menu__btn-title:focus { outline: 0; } .js .menu__btn--active { color: #e22d30; } .menu__list, .submenu__list { list-style: none; background: #2a2a2a; } .menu__item:hover \u0026gt; a { color: #ffa500; } .menu__item:first-child { border: 0; } .menu__item--active { background: #e22d30; } .menu__link { display: block; padding: 10px 15px; padding: 0.625rem 0.9375rem; font-weight: 700; color: #fff; text-transform: uppercase; } .menu__list .menu__item .submenu__list { background: #2a2a2a; visibility: hidden; opacity: 0; position: absolute; max-width: 15rem; transition: all 0.5s ease; border-top: 5px solid #e22d30; display: none; } .menu__item.menu__dropdown input[type=\u0026#34;checkbox\u0026#34;] { display: none; } .menu__list .menu__item:hover \u0026gt; .submenu__list, .menu__list .menu__item:focus-within \u0026gt; .submenu__list, .menu__list .menu__item .submenu__list:hover, .menu__list .menu__item .submenu__list:focus { visibility: visible; opacity: 1; display: block; } .menu__link:hover { color: #fff; } .js .menu__list { position: absolute; z-index: 1; width: 100%; visibility: hidden; -webkit-transform: scaleY(0); transform: scaleY(0); -webkit-transform-origin: top left; transform-origin: top left; } .js .menu__list--active { visibility: visible; border-top: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); -webkit-transform: scaleY(1); transform: scaleY(1); } .menu__list--transition { transition: visibility 0.15s ease, transform 0.15s ease, -webkit-transform 0.15s ease; } @media screen and (min-width: 767px) { .menu { border-bottom: 5px solid #e22d30; } .menu__btn { display: none; } .menu__list, .js .menu__list { position: relative; display: -webkit-flex; display: flex; -webkit-flex-wrap: wrap; flex-wrap: wrap; visibility: visible; border: 0; -webkit-transform: none; transform: none; } .menu__item { border-left: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); } } @media screen and (max-width: 767px) { .menu__item.menu__dropdown .drop-icon { position: absolute; right: 1rem; top: auto; } .menu__item.menu__dropdown input[type=\u0026#34;checkbox\u0026#34;] + .submenu__list { display: none; } .menu__item.menu__dropdown input[type=\u0026#34;checkbox\u0026#34;]:checked + .submenu__list { border: none; padding-left: 20px; visibility: visible; opacity: 1; display: block; position: relative; max-width: 100%; } } @media screen and (max-width: 620px) { .menu__item.menu__dropdown .drop-icon { position: absolute; right: 1rem; top: auto; } .menu__item.menu__dropdown input[type=\u0026#34;checkbox\u0026#34;] + .submenu__list { display: none; } .menu__item.menu__dropdown input[type=\u0026#34;checkbox\u0026#34;]:checked + .submenu__list { border: none; padding-left: 20px; visibility: visible; opacity: 1; display: block; position: relative; max-width: 100%; } } \nPosts to submenu mapping using Tags Now say you have created menu and submenu structure and now want to do mapping of your posts under each menu and submenu. I generally do it using tags.\nSay, I want to map my posts under Category ➞ Category1, I do that by adding tag in frontmatter like this:\nmyblogpost.md --- tags: - \u0026quot;category1\u0026quot; --- Now Hugo will map you post to the URL /tags/category1. You can use this URL to map submenu in config.toml\nconfig.toml  [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026quot;category1\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;Category1\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/tags/category1\u0026quot; parent = \u0026quot;category\u0026quot; weight = 1 Conclusion Please note that I am currently using Hugo Mainroad Theme so this example should just work fine for Mainroad theme. For other themes, you need to put extra effort in terms of creating menu.html partial and right CSS for nested menu structure. I hope this tutorial will give you the basic idea in which direction you need to go.\nPlease comment in case you find any issue to follow the tutorial.

If you haven\u0026rsquo;t registered to AWS already, follow this Step-by-step guide to create an AWS Account\nWhat is AWS DeepRacer? AWS DeepRacer is an exciting way for developers to get hands-on experience with machine learning.\nIn AWS DeepRacer, you use a 1/18 scale autonomous car equipped with sensors and cameras. You can use this car in virtual simulator, to train and evaluate. The same car is used in physical AWS DeepRacer global racing league.\nIn AWS DeepRacer, You do this:\n build your car, or choose existing one, create your own reinforcement learning model, or choose from sample models, choose pre-defined racing track, train and evaluate your car on racing track using your model , and finally you compete with others.\n  Reinforcement learning  Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how an agents should take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s understand the reinforcement learning key terms from AWS DeepRacer perspective:\n AWS DeepRacer Key Terms\n   model is created when you choose a car, racing track and write your reward function. agent is your Car action space is the amount of choices a Car has, for e.g., turn left, turn right, move forward at different speeds. state is position of Car on the track at a point of time. environment is the Racing Track of your Car reward function is a function written in python which returns reward in floating point number. Your car use this reward function in its training and try to accumulate more reward points training phase is when you train your car on racing track using the model you created.\nAlso known as exploration phase where your car explore the racing track, and learn from which route it can get more reward points. evaluating phase is when you evaluate your car after training is completed whether its able to complete the racing track or not. Also known as exploitation phase where your car exploit the learning from training and try to reach the convergence (finish line). The hyper parameters are reinforcement algorithm and training specific parameters which controls the car training process. You car make attempts to find the best route by accumulating reward point in training phase. Attempt starts either from the start line or any part of the track. Attempt ends when car reaches the finish line, or loose the track, or crash. Each of this attempt is called an episode.\n  Reward function Reward function is a python function where you give higher reward points for good behavior and lower reward points for bad behavior.\nHere is sample reward function written in python which gives higher reward points to car for keeping it wheels on track:\ndef reward_function(params): # Read input parameters all_wheels_on_track = params[\u0026#39;all_wheels_on_track\u0026#39;] if all_wheels_on_track: reward = 1.0 # higher reward for car to be on track else reward = 1e-3 # lower reward for car to go outside track return float(reward) When you train your car, it attempts to run at different angles and speed on the track and try to accumulate reward points. In each subsequent attempts, it learns from its previous attempts and try to accumulate more reward points by keeping it wheels on track.\n1. Getting Started ① Go to AWS Services ➞ AWS DeepRacer ➞ Reinforcement Learning ➞ Get Started\n② If it is your first time, you will see some errors. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry.

Choose Next\n③ Keep the action space settings as below. Choose Next  AWS DeepRacer Action Space for Beginners\n  ④ Enter the name of your car and Choose color. Choose Done\n\nAction Space You car can turn left, turn right, move forward at different speeds. All these choice become the action spaces of the Car. Action space of a Car depends on following parameters:\n Maximum Steering Angle: Max values are between 1 and 30. Steering angle granularity: Possible values are 3, 5 and 7 Maximum speed: Select values between 0.1m/s and 4m/s. Speed granularity: Possible values are 1, 2 and 3  If you choose 5 Steering angles granularity and 3 Speeds granularity then it has total (5*3) = 15 action spaces (all combinations of angles vs speed). A car choose random action out of these 15 action spaces in its trail and errors.\n Action Space = Steering angles granularity * Speeds granularity Note that more the action spaces, more the choices a Car has to choose from. You might get the best finishing time and best time around the curve with more action spaces but it requires a lot of training and your Car might not reach the convergence (finish the racing track). Same is applicable for maximum speed.\nAs a beginner, it is advised to use:\n 3 steering angles and 3 speeds to start with (3*3) = 9 action spaces maximum speed to 1m/s to train your car faster.  Your primary focus while training your car should be on the accuracy and reliability of your model and not the speed or lap time of your Car. Once you have some insights, you can train your car by increasing the action spaces and max speed.\n3. Create Model There are five out of the box models available to use in AWS DeepRacer:\n   Name Description Status Sensors     Sample-Head-to-Head Model trained with reward function for head to head racing Ready Stereo camera, Lidar   Sample-Object-Avoidance Model trained with reward function that avoids objects Ready Stereo camera   Sample-Time-Trial-PreventZigZag Model trained with reward function that penalizes the agent for steering too much Ready Camera   Sample-Time-Trial-StayOnTrack Model trained with reward function that incentivizes the agent to stay inside the track borders Ready Stereo camera   Sample-Time-Trial-FollowCenterLine Model trained with reward function that incentivizes the agent to follow the center line Ready Camera     I recommend to click on each model, Go to their Training Configuration ➞ Reward Function and Action Space which will give you an idea on how to design your own model.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create our own model:\n① Go to AWS DeepRacer ➞ Reinforcement Learning ➞ Your models and Choose Create Model\n② Enter Model name and description\n③ Choose a Racing Track. To follow with me, Choose ⦿ re:Invent 2018 and Choose Next\n④ Choose a Race Type. To follow with me, Choose ⦿ Time trial\n⑤ Choose an Agent (Car). To follow with me, Choose a car which we created earlier. Alternatively Choose default car \u0026ldquo;The Original DeepRacer\u0026rdquo;\n⑥ Clear Reward Function Code Editor. Copy and Paste following reward function in code editor and Click Validate to make sure this code is valid.\n ⑦ Keep the default setting of Training Algorithm ⦿ PPO and hyperparameters.\n⑧ Enter Stop Condition ➞ Maximum time = 60 minutes.\nNote: Congratulations, You\u0026rsquo;ve configured your model. Next step is to create, train and evaluate your model. Please note that you have not charged anything till this point. Subsequent steps will charge you money based on AWS resource utilization.\n⑨ Once you choose Create Model. AWS resources will be provisioned to train your model for 60 minutes.\n\nReward Graph It is recommended to watch the reward graph and simulator video stream while your car is training. This was a thrilling experience for me to watch the live training of car using my first ever machine learning model.\n AWS DeepRacer Reward Graph and Simulator Video Stream\n  You should know how to read the reward graph in order to understand your model behavior:\n Average Reward is reward points your car is accumulating in each attempt. Average reward line should go up linearly in the perfect scenario but this is rare. This is what you should look:  Average Reward line should go up in the longer time period. That means your car is able to learn from its past failures and able to accumulate more reward points in subsequent attempts. If Average Reward line go down in shorter period then do not worry. That means your car is trying to attempt those directions which return less reward points. Your car would learn from those attempts and won\u0026rsquo;t try them again in subsequent attempts.   There are two phases when your car is training, you will notice them if you are watching simulator video:  Training Phase: Your car trains on different parts of the racing track by starting at random positions. Evaluating Phase: You car starts from the starting point of racing track and try to complete the track.   Average percentage completion (Training) is percentage of track completed in training phase. Since in training phase, main aim of car is to train at different parts of the track, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t complete the track most of the time and hence the graph line remain below and doesn\u0026rsquo;t touch 100% marker. Average percentage completion (Evaluating) is percentage of track completed in evaluating phase. Since in evaluating phase, main aim of car is to complete the track, it should touch the 100% marker and able to finish the racing track. If this graph line is not touching 100% marker then there are higher chances of your model failing in actual race.\n  Hyperparameters Tuning the hyperparameters can improve the quality of your model but it requires a steep learning curve and a lot of trials and errors. As a beginner, it is advised to use default optimized parameters but at the same time, it is good to know how they impact the training of your Car.\n Number of episodes per iteration: Each attempt made by car in training phase is one episode. With Default value, a Car make 20 attempts in one iteration before updating training data to the network. Batch Size: Iterations runs in batches. Batch size controls, how many iterations to be completed before updating training data to the network. Number of Epochs: Number of times to repeat the batches and send optimized training data to network. Larger number of epochs is acceptable when the batch size is large. Learning Rate: Controls the speed your car learns. Large learning rate prevents training data from reaching optimal solution whereas Small learning rate takes longer to learn. Entropy: It is a degree of randomness in the Car\u0026rsquo;s action. Larger the entropy means the more random actions a Car will take for exploration. Discount Factor: It is a factor specifies how much of the future reward contributes to the expected rewards. With larger discount factor, Car looks further into the future to consider rewards. With smaller discount factor, Car only consider immediate rewards.  Take a quick look at hyperparameters:\n   Hyperparamter Advantage of higher values Disadvantage of higher values Default     Batch Size More stable updates Slower training 64   Number of Epochs More stable updates Slower training 10   Learning Rate Car learns faster May struggle to converge 0.0003   Entropy More experimental may lead to better results May struggle to converge 0.01   Discount Factor Model looks farther out Slower training 0.999   Episodes Improves model stability Slower training 20     Personal Experience When i started making my first model, I thought that i will make my first model as master piece. I selected max out configuration i.e. max speed 4m/s and maximum action spaces and training period as 2 hours. It failed miserably. It was not able to finish the track even in 2 hours training period and the reward graphs were all going in wrong direction.\nAfter that I used the model configuration and reward function as mentioned in the post and able to finish the track in 60 min training time. I, then increased the max-speed from 1m/s to 1.5m/s and able to finish the reInvent:2018 track in ~19 seconds.\nI recommend:-\n Make you model with above example. Learn from the reward graph and simulator video. Take one step at a time say increase the max-speed from 1m/s to 1.5m/s and train again. Continue to progress\u0026hellip;  Thanks for Reading. I am still in learning phase of AWS DeepRacer and keep updating this post based on my new findings.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/aws/aws-deepracer/","tags":["AWS","Popular Posts"],"title":"Build Your First AWS DeepRacer Model"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll learn the usage of Array Destructuring in JavaScript ES6 with examples.\n Destructuring Assignment is a special syntax introduced in JavaScript ES6 that allows us to extract multiple items from an array or object and assign them to variables, in a single statement.\n Also Read: Object Destructuring\nBasic Array Destructuring We can extract multiple elements from an Array and assign them to variables using Array Destructuring in a single statement.\nArray Destructuring shorthand syntax is quite handy as compare to our traditional way of assigning elements to the variables one by one.\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3]; //const one = numbers[0]; //Traditional Way //const two = numbers[1]; //const three = numbers[2];  const [one, two, three] = numbers; //Array Destructuring  console.log(one); //1 console.log(two); //2 console.log(three); //3 We can also declare the variables before assigned:\nlet one, two, three; const numbers = [1, 2, 3]; [one, two, three] = numbers; console.log(one); //1 console.log(two); //2 console.log(three); //3 or we can declare them inline:\nconst [one, two, three] = [1, 2, 3]; console.log(one); //1 console.log(two); //2 console.log(three); //3 Default Values We can give default values to the array elements that are undefined or doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nconst numbers = [1, undefined, 3]; const [one = \u0026#34;I\u0026#34;, two = \u0026#34;II\u0026#34;, three = \u0026#34;III\u0026#34;, four = \u0026#34;IV\u0026#34;] = numbers; console.log(one); //1 console.log(two); //II \u0026lt;- default value since \u0026#39;undefined\u0026#39; console.log(three); //3 console.log(four); //IV \u0026lt;- default value since doesn\u0026#39;t exist We see that second element is undefined and fourth element doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Default value is assigned to the variable in both the cases.\nNested Array Destructuring We can also perform nested Array Destructuring to get elements from nested array at deeper levels:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, [9, 10, [11, 12]]]; const [one, two, [nine, ten, [eleven, twelve]]] = numbers console.log(one) //1 console.log(nine) //9 console.log(eleven) //11 An alternate for nested Array Destructuring is to use ES9 Array.flat() method, which flatten the nested array into a normal one:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, [9, 10, [11, 12]]]; const flattenNumbers = numbers.flat().flat(); const [one, two, nine, ten, eleven, twelve] = flattenNumbers; console.log(one) //1 console.log(nine) //9 console.log(eleven) //11 Note that Array.flat() method flatten the nested array at one level deep. That is why we have called this method two times numbers.flat().flat() to flatten at two levels deep.\nAlso note that Array.flat() method is shorter version of Array.flatMap() method, both works same:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, [9, 10, [11, 12]]]; const flat = numbers.flat(); const flatMap = numbers.flatMap(x =\u0026gt; x); console.log(flat); // [1, 2, 9, 10, [11, 12]] console.log(flatMap); // [1, 2, 9, 10, [11, 12]]  // flatten one more level deeper const flatDeep = flat.flat(); const flatMapDeep = flatMap.flatMap(x =\u0026gt; x); console.log(flatDeep); // [1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12] console.log(flatMapDeep); // [1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12] Skipping Elements using commas We can also skip some of the elements by using comma separator. Let\u0026rsquo;s get the first and fourth element of the array:\nlet [one, , , four] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; console.log(one); //1 console.log(four); //4 Here two extra comma separators , ,  in Array Destructuring skip the second and third element. Similarly let\u0026rsquo;s skip the first and third element:\nlet [ , two , , four] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; console.log(two); //2 console.log(four); //4 Rest of the Elements We can also use rest operator ... to get rest of the elements from an array like this:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; const [one, two, three, ...others] = numbers; console.log(one); //1 console.log(two); //1 console.log(three); //1 console.log(others); //[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] Note that rest operator can always be used at last, otherwise it throws error.\nRest and Spread Operators Often we get confused with Rest and Spread operator as both use the same ... syntax. Rest and Spread operators can be used together in the Array Destructuring statement:\n Rest Operator: Used at the left hand side of statement to get the rest of the elements from an array Spread Operator: Used at the right hand side of statement to copy elements to an array  const tens = [10, 20, 30]; const hundreds = [100, 200]; const thousands = [1000]; // Rest operator // Spread Operator const [one, two, ten, twenty, ...others] = [1, 2, ...tens, ...hundreds, ...thousands];; console.log(one); //1 console.log(two); //2 console.log(ten); //10 console.log(twenty); //20 console.log(others); //[30, 100, 200, 1000] Destructuring Return Statement We can extract data from an array returned from a function using Array Destructuring in this way:\nfunction getNumberArray() { return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; } var [one, ...others] = getNumberArray(); console.log(one); //1 console.log(others); //[2, 3, 4, 5] Destructuring Function Arguments We can even pass an array into a function and then extract only the elements we want using Array Destructuring in this way:\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; function getNumberArray( [ one, ...others ] ) { console.log(one); //1  console.log(others); //[2, 3, 4, 5] } getNumberArray(numbers); Practical Use Cases Inside for-of loop We can use Array Destructuring inside for-of loop in this way:\nconst numbers = [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 7, 8, 9 ] ]; for (let [ a, b, c ] of numbers) { console.log(a, b, c); } // 1 2 3 // 4 5 6 // 7 8 9 Inside forEach function We can iterate through Objects easily using Array Destructuring.\nconst obj = { foo: \u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;, baz: 42 }; Object.entries(obj).forEach(([key, value]) =\u0026gt; console.log(`${key}: ${value}`)); // \u0026#34;foo: bar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;baz: 42\u0026#34; We see that Object.entries returns an Array with key-value pairs which is extracted using [key, value] destructuring.\nInside Map iteration We can also destruct the key-value pairs of a Map using [key, value] destructuring.\nvar map = new Map(); map.set(\u0026#34;one\u0026#34;, 1); map.set(\u0026#34;two\u0026#34;, 2); for (var [key, value] of map) { console.log(key + \u0026#34; is \u0026#34; + value); } // one is 1 // two is 2 Iterate over only the keys:\nfor (var [key] of map) { // ... } Or iterate over only the values:\nfor (var [,value] of map) { // ... } Swapping values This is quite interesting to swap values using Array Destructuring:\nlet one = 1; let two = 2; [one, two] = [two, one]; console.log(one); //2 console.log(two); //1 Regular Expression Regular expressions functions such as match return an array of matched items, which can be mapped to variables using Array Destructuring:\nconst [a, b, c, d] = \u0026#39;one two three\u0026#39;.match(/\\w+/g); // a = \u0026#39;one\u0026#39;, b = \u0026#39;two\u0026#39;, c = \u0026#39;three\u0026#39;, d = undefined ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/array-destructuring/","tags":["JavaScript ES6","Javascript Array"],"title":"How to use Array Destructuring in JavaScript"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll learn the usage of Object Destructuring in JavaScript ES6 with examples.\n Destructuring Assignment is a special syntax introduced in JavaScript ES6 that allows us to extract multiple items from an array or object and assign them to variables, in a single statement.\n Also Read: Array Destructuring\nBasic Object Destructuring We can extract multiple properties from an Object and assign them to variables using Object Destructuring in a single statement.\nObject Destructuring shorthand syntax is quite handy as compare to our traditional way of assigning properties to the variables one by one.\nconst person = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, company: \u0026#34;Google\u0026#34;, job: \u0026#34;Developer\u0026#34; }; // let name = person.name; //Traditional Way // let company = person.company; // let job = person.job;  const { name, company, job } = person; //Object Destructuring We can declare the variables inline as well:\nconst { name, company, job } = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, company: \u0026#34;Google\u0026#34;, job: \u0026#34;Developer\u0026#34; }; Assignment without Declaration We can declare the variables without assignment.

Some of the common use cases I came across are as follows:\nInside for-of loop We can use Object Destructuring inside for-of loop in this way:\nconst users = [{ name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, company: \u0026#34;Google\u0026#34;, job: \u0026#34;Developer\u0026#34; }, { name: \u0026#34;Adam\u0026#34;, company: \u0026#34;Microsoft\u0026#34;, job: \u0026#34;Analyst\u0026#34; }, { name: \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, company: \u0026#34;Yahoo\u0026#34;, job: \u0026#34;Data Scientist\u0026#34; }]; for (let {name, company} of users) { console.log(name, company); } // John Google // Adam Microsoft // Bob Yahoo Inside map function We can use Object Destructuring inside map function in this way:\nconst users = [{ name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, company: \u0026#34;Google\u0026#34;, job: \u0026#34;Developer\u0026#34; }, { name: \u0026#34;Adam\u0026#34;, company: \u0026#34;Microsoft\u0026#34;, job: \u0026#34;Analyst\u0026#34; }, { name: \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, company: \u0026#34;Yahoo\u0026#34;, job: \u0026#34;Data Scientist\u0026#34; }]; const userNames = users.map(({ name }) =\u0026gt; name); console.log(userNames); //[\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Adam\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;] Named Export We can choose what to export from the module using Object Destructuring, and import keyword. If you have worked with Angular, React or any other JavaScript framework. You might have come across Named Export like this:\nimport React, { Component } from \u0026#39;React\u0026#39;; // Old way import React from \u0026#39;React\u0026#39;; class MyComponent extends React.Component{} // New way import React, { Component } from \u0026#39;React\u0026#39;; class MyComponent extends Component{} Same thing applies for any other package we import, we can choose only the functions we want and use them independently.\nimport { isEmail, isCreditCard } from \u0026#39;validator\u0026#39;; console.log(isEmail(\u0026#39;my@email.com\u0026#39;)); // true Console API We can destructure functions from Console API object:\nconst { log, warn, error } = console; log(\u0026#39;Hello World!\u0026#39;); // equivalent to console.log(\u0026#39;...\u0026#39;); warn(\u0026#39;Watch out!\u0026#39;); // console.warn(\u0026#39;...\u0026#39;); error(\u0026#39;Something went wrong!\u0026#39;); // console.error(\u0026#39;...\u0026#39;); Swapping Variables This is interesting to see that we can swap variables using Object Destructuring\nlet a = \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;; let b = \u0026#34;b\u0026#34;; [b, a] = [a, b]; console.log(a); // b console.log(b); // a HTML Elements We can destructure properties of HTML Elements like this:\nconst { value } = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;input\u0026#39;); This way it’s much easier to get a value property out of an input element, just as getting disabled property out of a button element.\nconst { disabled } = document.querySelector(\u0026#39;button\u0026#39;); HTML Events Let\u0026rsquo;s handle HTML Events using destructuring function arguments like this:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;text\u0026#34; onchange=\u0026#34;handleChange(event)\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; Now we are going to extract a target object from an event object and then extract a value property from the target:\n// #1 function handleChange(event) { const { value } = event.target; console.log(value); } // # 2 function handleChange({ target }) { const { value } = target; console.log(value); } // # 3 function handleChange({ target: { value } }) { console.log(value); } Conditional Object Creation We can also create an object at runtime based on conditions using Object Destructuring\nconst isEmployed = true; const friends = [\u0026#34;Adam\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Charlie\u0026#34;]; const hobbies = null; const user = { name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, ...(isEmployed \u0026amp;\u0026amp; { company: \u0026#34;Google\u0026#34;, job: \u0026#34;Developer\u0026#34; }), ...(friends \u0026amp;\u0026amp; {friends}), ...(hobbies \u0026amp;\u0026amp; {hobbies}) }; console.log(user); // prints {name: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, company: \u0026#34;Google\u0026#34;, job: \u0026#34;Developer\u0026#34;, friends: [\u0026#34;Adam\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Charlie\u0026#34;]} ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/object-destructuring/","tags":["JavaScript ES6","Javascript Object"],"title":"How to use Object Destructuring in JavaScript"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"In this quick tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to capitalize the first letter of a String in JavaScript.\n\u0026lsquo;capitalize\u0026rsquo; Function You can use this custom made capitalize() function to capitalize the first letter of a string:\n// es5 way function capitalize(string) { return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1); } // es6 way using destructuring const capitalize = ([first,...rest]) =\u0026gt; first.toUpperCase() + rest.join(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); \u0026lsquo;capitalize\u0026rsquo; Function Details Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the steps involved to come up with capitalize() function:\n Get the first letter of the string using charAt() method const string = \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;; string.charAt(0); // Returns \u0026#34;s\u0026#34;  Convert the first letter to uppercase using toUpperCase() method const string = \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;; string.charAt(0).toUpperCase(); // Returns \u0026#34;S\u0026#34;  Get the rest of the string except first letter using slice() method const string = \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;; string.slice(1); // Returns \u0026#34;tring\u0026#34; Note that slice(1) means get a substring from index 1 to end of the string.

Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the code where two things are going on:\n First, we create a new Set object by passing an array which removes the duplicates. Second, we convert this object back to an array by using spread operator ...  const fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;]; const uniqueSet = new Set(fruits); // ▶ Set(3) {\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;}  const backToArray = [...uniqueSet]; // ▶ (3) [\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;] Alternatively, you can also use Array.from to convert a Set into an array:\nconst fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;]; const uniqueFruits = Array.from(new Set(fruits)); // ▶ Set(3) {\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;} Use Array.filter() The filter() method filter out the elements from an array based on the condition we provide. In other words,\n if the condition returns true, it will be included in filtered array if the condition returns false, it will NOT be included in filtered array  const fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;]; const uniqueFruits = fruits.filter((item, index) =\u0026gt; fruits.indexOf(item) == index); // ▶ Set(3) {\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;} Here use of Array.indexOf() method is very important which gives you the first occurrence of element in case there are duplicates. Let\u0026rsquo;s see the code:\nconst fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;]; fruits.indexOf(\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;); //0 fruits.indexOf(\u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;); //1 fruits.indexOf(\u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;); //4 In the above case, our filter() method filters out the first occurrence of each unique element.\nUse Array.forEach() The forEach() method can also be used to loop through elements of an array and push() elements to the new array which is not already there.\nconst fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;]; const uniqueFruits = []; fruits.forEach(item =\u0026gt; !uniqueFruits.includes(item) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; uniqueFruits.push(item)); console.log(uniqueFruits); // ▶ Set(3) {\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;} Use Array.reduce() The reduce() method is used to reduce the elements of the array and combine them into a new array based on some reducer function that you pass.\nIn this case, our reducer function is checking if our new array contains the item. If it doesn’t, push that item into our new array. Otherwise, skip that element and return just our new array as is.\nReduce is always bit difficult to understand. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the code:\nconst fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;orange\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;]; const uniqueFruits = fruits.reduce((newarray, item) =\u0026gt; newarray.includes(item) ? newarray : [...newarray, item], []); console.log(uniqueFruits); // ▶ Set(3) {\u0026#34;apple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;orange\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;banana\u0026#34;} Performance We have created an array with 1 million random numbers (ranging from 1 to 1000). Let\u0026rsquo;s check the performance of each method.\n// Array: var numbers = []; for ( var i = 0; i \u0026lt; 1000000; i++ ) { numbers.push(Math.floor((Math.random() * 1000) + 1)); } // 1. ES6 Set console.time(\u0026#34;set\u0026#34;); [...new Set(numbers)]; console.timeEnd(\u0026#34;set\u0026#34;); // 2. filter console.time(\u0026#34;filter\u0026#34;); numbers.filter((item, index) =\u0026gt; numbers.indexOf(item) == index); console.timeEnd(\u0026#34;filter\u0026#34;); // 3. forEach console.time(\u0026#34;forEach\u0026#34;); var uniqueNumbers = []; numbers.forEach(item =\u0026gt; !uniqueNumbers.includes(item) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; uniqueNumbers.push(item)); console.timeEnd(\u0026#34;forEach\u0026#34;); // 4. reduce console.time(\u0026#34;reduce\u0026#34;); numbers.reduce((newarray, item) =\u0026gt; newarray.includes(item) ? newarray : [...newarray, item], []); console.timeEnd(\u0026#34;reduce\u0026#34;); Here is the result when i ran the above code on MacBook Pro\u0026rsquo;s Google Chrome v83.0.4103.106 (64-bit):\nset: 23.051025390625ms filter: 1004.9609375ms forEach: 471.6630859375ms reduce: 472.902099609375ms We see that ES6 Set object is a clear winner followed by forEach loop.

Shallow copy means the first level is copied and deeper levels are referenced.\nShallow copy is good enough when you are working with one-dimensional array. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at different ways to clone an array using shallow copy:\nES6 Spread Operator If you have started using ES6 then it is recommended to use spread operator to clone an array in JavaScript. It\u0026rsquo;s short syntax is very handy.\nconst fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;]; const cloneFruits = [...fruits]; // [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;] Array.slice() If you are still working old way then Array.slice can be used to clone an array:\nconst fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;]; const cloneFruits = fruits.slice(); // [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;] Array.from() We can also use Array.from method to clone an array:\nconst fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;]; const cloneFruits = Array.from(fruits); // [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;] Problem with Shallow Copy Let\u0026rsquo;s see how shallow copy behaves with multi-dimensional (nested) array:\nconst fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;]; const veggies = [\u0026#39;onion\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;potato\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;tomato\u0026#39;]; const liquids = [\u0026#39;milk\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;juice\u0026#39;]; const grocery = [fruits, veggies, liquids]; const groceryCopy = [...grocery]; grocery[2].push(\u0026#39;beer\u0026#39;); console.log(grocery); console.log(groceryCopy); // (3) [[\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;onion\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;potato\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;tomato\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;milk\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;juice\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;beer\u0026#39;]] // (3) [[\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;onion\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;potato\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;tomato\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;milk\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;juice\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;beer\u0026#39;]] // They\u0026#39;ve both been changed because they share references We see that both Array and its shallow copy have been changed because they share the reference. Remember, deeper levels are referenced in shallow copy.\nDeep copy We can use deep copy instead to solve the problem arises with shallow copy of multi-dimensional (nested) array. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at different ways to clone an array using deep copy:\nJSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() We can make a deep copy of an Array using the combination of JSON.stringify and JSON.parse\n JSON.stringify turns an object into a string. JSON.parse turns a string into an object.  const fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;]; const veggies = [\u0026#39;onion\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;potato\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;tomato\u0026#39;]; const liquids = [\u0026#39;milk\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;juice\u0026#39;]; const grocery = [fruits, veggies, liquids]; const groceryCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(grocery)); grocery[2].push(\u0026#39;beer\u0026#39;); console.log(grocery); console.log(groceryCopy); // (3) [[\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;onion\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;potato\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;tomato\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;milk\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;juice\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;beer\u0026#39;]] // (3) [[\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;onion\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;potato\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;tomato\u0026#39;], [\u0026#39;milk\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;juice\u0026#39;]] // These two arrays are completely separate!

Keep following this post for regular updates.\n Also Read Core Java Interview Questions\nAlso Read Java Multithreading (Concurrency) Interview Questions\n Q1. What New Features Were Added in Java 8? Java 8 ships with several new features but the most significant are the following:\n Lambda Expressions − a new language feature allowing treating actions as objects Method References − enable defining Lambda Expressions by referring to methods directly using their names Optional − special wrapper class used for expressing optionality Functional Interface – an interface with maximum one abstract method, implementation can be provided using a Lambda Expression Default methods − give us the ability to add full implementations in interfaces besides abstract methods Nashorn, JavaScript Engine − Java-based engine for executing and evaluating JavaScript code Stream API − a special iterator class that allows processing collections of objects in a functional manner Date API − an improved, immutable JodaTime-inspired Date API  Along with these new features, lots of feature enhancements are done under-the-hood, at both compiler and JVM level.\nQ2. What Is a Method Reference? A method reference is a Java 8 construct that can be used for referencing a method without invoking it using double colon :: operator. It is used for treating methods as Lambda Expressions. They only work as syntactic sugar to reduce the verbosity of some lambdas. See below code, how method reference has reduced the verbosity over lambda expression.\nList\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; languages = Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;java\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;javascript\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;css\u0026#34;); // Lambda expression languages.forEach(str -\u0026gt; System.out.println(str)); // Method Reference languages.forEach(System.out::println); Double colon :: is basically refers to a single method, and this single method can be a\n A Static method ClassName::staticMethodName\ne.g. String::valueOf, Integer::parseInteger, Double::parseDouble An Instance method Object::instanceMethodName\ne.g. String::toString, System.out::println, String::toUpperCase A Constructor ClassName::new\ne.g. String::new A Super method super::parentMethodName   Read Double Colon Operators in Java 8 for more details on method reference.\n Q3. What Is a Functional Interface? A Functional Interface is an interface having one and only one abstract method. Though it can have one or more default methods.\nFunctional interface is annotated with @FunctionalInterface - which is informative and does not affect the semantics.\nExamples Java has some built-in functional interface such as java.lang.Runnable which is having only one run() abstract method.\n@FunctionalInterface public interface Runnable { public abstract void run(); } Another functional interface is java.util.Comparator which is having one compare() abstract method, and many default and static methods.\n@FunctionalInterface public interface Comparator\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { int compare(T o1, T o2); default Comparator\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; reversed() { return Collections.reverseOrder(this); } ... public static \u0026lt;T extends Comparable\u0026lt;? super T\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Comparator\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; reverseOrder() { return Collections.reverseOrder(); } ... } Usage Functional interface can be replaced by Lambda Expression. For instance, instead of:\nThread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() { public void run() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;); } }); List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; a1 = Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;equity\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;stocks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gold\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;foreign exchange\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;fixed income\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;future\u0026#34;); a1.sort(new Comparator\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;() { @Override public int compare(String o1, String o2) { return o1.compareTo(o2); } }); you could simply do:\nThread thread = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;)); List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; a1 = Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;equity\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;stocks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gold\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;foreign exchange\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;fixed income\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;future\u0026#34;); a1.sort((o1, o2) -\u0026gt; o2.compareTo(o1)); Q4. What Is a Default Method and When Do We Use It? A default method is a method with an implementation – which can be found in an interface.\nWe can use a default method to add a new functionality to an interface while maintaining backward compatibility with classes that are already implementing the interface:\npublic interface Vehicle { public void move(); default void hoot() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;peep!\u0026#34;); } } Usually, when a new abstract method is added to an interface, all implementing classes will break until they implement the new abstract method. In Java 8, this problem has been solved by the use of default method.\nFor example, Collection interface does not have forEach method declaration. Thus, adding such method would simply break the whole collections API.\nJava 8 introduces default method so that Collection interface can have a default implementation of forEach method without requiring the classes implementing this interface to implement the same.\nQ5. Will the Following Code Compile? @FunctionalInterface public interface Function2\u0026lt;T, U, V\u0026gt; { public V apply(T t, U u); default void count() { // increment counter  } } Yes. The code will compile because it follows the functional interface specification of defining only a single abstract method apply. The second method count, is a default method.\nQ6. Describe Some of the Functional Interfaces in the Standard Library. There are a lot of functional interfaces in the java.util.function package, the more common ones include but not limited to:\n Function – it takes one argument and returns a result Consumer – it takes one argument and returns no result (represents a side effect) Supplier – it takes not argument and returns a result Predicate – it takes one argument and returns a boolean BiFunction – it takes two arguments and returns a result BinaryOperator – it is similar to a BiFunction, taking two arguments and returning a result. The two arguments and the result are all of the same types UnaryOperator – it is similar to a Function, taking a single argument and returning a result of the same type  Q7. What Is a Lambda Expression and What Is It Used for? In very simple terms, a lambda expression is a function that can be referenced and passed around as an object.\nLambda expressions introduce functional style processing in Java and facilitate the writing of compact and easy-to-read code.\nBecause of this, lambda expressions are a natural replacement for anonymous classes as method arguments. One of their main uses is to define inline implementations of functional interfaces.\n//Java 7 way of initializing a thread Thread t1 = new Thread(new Runnable(){ @Override public void run() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Thread started in Java7\u0026#34;); } }); t1.start(); //Java 8 Lambda Expression Thread t2 = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; System.out.println(\u0026#34;Thread started in Java8\u0026#34;)); t2.start(); //Java 7 way of sorting list List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; a1 = Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;equity\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;stocks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;gold\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;foreign exchange\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;fixed income\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;future\u0026#34;); a1.sort(new Comparator\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;() { @Override public int compare(String o1, String o2) { return o1.compareTo(o2); } }); //Java 8 Lambda Expression a1.sort((o1, o2) -\u0026gt; o2.compareTo(o1)); Q8. Explain the Syntax and Characteristics of a Lambda Expression? A lambda expression consists of two parts: the parameter part and the expressions part separated by a forward arrow as below:\n// Syntax param -\u0026gt; expression Any lambda expression has the following characteristics:\n Optional type declaration – when declaring the parameters on the left-hand side of the lambda, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to declare their types as the compiler can infer them from their values. Optional parentheses – when only a single parameter is declared, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to place it in parentheses. But when more than one parameter is declared, parentheses are required Optional curly braces – when the expressions part only has a single statement, there is no need for curly braces. But curly braces are required when there is more than one statement Optional return statement – when there is only single statement, then we can omit return keyword from return statement.  // Lamda Expression Stream.of(\u0026#34;java\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;spring\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;spring boot\u0026#34;).filter((String s) -\u0026gt; { return s == \u0026#34;java\u0026#34;; }); // Removed Optional Type Declaration, Parentheses, Curly Braces and Return Keyword Stream.of(\u0026#34;java\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;spring\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;spring boot\u0026#34;).filter(s -\u0026gt; s == \u0026#34;java\u0026#34;); Q9. What Is a Stream? How Does It Differ from a Collection? In simple terms, a stream is an iterator whose role is to accept a set of actions to apply on each of the elements it contains.\nThe stream represents a sequence of objects from a source such as a collection, which supports aggregate operations. They were designed to make collection processing simple and concise. Contrary to the collections, the logic of iteration is implemented inside the stream, so we can use methods like map and flatMap for performing a declarative processing.\nAnother difference is that the Stream API is fluent and allows pipelining:\nint sum = Arrays.stream(new int[]{1, 2, 3}) .filter(i -\u0026gt; i \u0026gt;= 2) .map(i -\u0026gt; i * 3) .sum(); And yet another important distinction from collections is that streams are inherently lazily loaded and processed.\nQ10. What is the Difference Between Intermediate and Terminal Operations? Stream operations are combined into pipelines to process streams. All operations are either intermediate or terminal.\nIntermediate operations are those operations that return Stream itself allowing for further operations on a stream.\nThese operations are always lazy, i.e. they do not process the stream at the call site, an intermediate operation can only process data when there is a terminal operation. Some of the intermediate operations are filter, map and flatMap.\nTerminal operations terminate the pipeline and initiate stream processing. The stream is passed through all intermediate operations during terminal operation call. Terminal operations include forEach, reduce, Collect and sum.\nTo drive this point home, let us look at an example with side effects:\npublic static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Stream without terminal operation\u0026#34;); Arrays.stream(new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }).map(i -\u0026gt; { System.out.println(\u0026#34;doubling \u0026#34; + i); return i * 2; }); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Stream with terminal operation\u0026#34;); Arrays.stream(new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }).map(i -\u0026gt; { System.out.println(\u0026#34;doubling \u0026#34; + i); return i * 2; }).sum(); } The output will be as follows:\nOutput Stream without terminal operation Stream with terminal operation doubling 1 doubling 2 doubling 3 As you can see, the intermediate operations are only triggered when a terminal operation exists.\nQ11. What is the Difference Between Map and flatMap Stream Operation? There is a difference in signature between map and flatMap. Generally speaking, a map operation wraps its return value inside its ordinal type while flatMap does not.\nFor example, in Optional, a map operation would return Optional\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; type while flatMap would return String type.\nSo after mapping, one needs to unwrap (read “flatten”) the object to retrieve the value whereas, after flat mapping, there is no such need as the object is already flattened. The same concept is applied to mapping and flat mapping in Stream.\nBoth map and flatMap are intermediate stream operations that receive a function and apply this function to all elements of a stream.\nThe difference is that for the map, this function returns a value, but for flatMap, this function returns a stream. The flatMap operation “flattens” the streams into one.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example where we take a map of users' names and lists of phones and “flatten” it down to a list of phones of all the users using flatMap:\nMap\u0026lt;String, List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;\u0026gt; people = new HashMap\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); people.put(\u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;555-1123\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;555-3389\u0026#34;)); people.put(\u0026#34;Mary\u0026#34;, Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;555-2243\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;555-5264\u0026#34;)); people.put(\u0026#34;Steve\u0026#34;, Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;555-6654\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;555-3242\u0026#34;)); List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; phones = people.values().stream() .flatMap(Collection::stream) .collect(Collectors.toList()); Q12. What Is Stream Pipelining in Java 8? Stream pipelining is the concept of chaining operations together. This is done by splitting the operations that can happen on a stream into two categories: intermediate operations and terminal operations.\nEach intermediate operation returns an instance of Stream itself when it runs, an arbitrary number of intermediate operations can, therefore, be set up to process data forming a processing pipeline.\nThere must then be a terminal operation which returns a final value and terminates the pipeline.\nQ13. What is Effectively Final in Java 8? Java 8 has introduced a new concept called \u0026ldquo;effectively final\u0026rdquo; variable. A non-final local variable or method parameter whose value is never changed after initialization is known as effectively final.\nIf you remember, prior to Java 8, we cannot use a local variable in an anonymous class. If you have to access a local variable in the Anonymous class, you have to make it final.\nIn Java 8, you can use non-final local variable in an anonymous class or lambda expression, if its value is never changed. Java internally consider these variables as effectively final and allow them to use.\nThe below code will throw error prior to Java 8 since message variable is not final, however it works just fine with Java 8 and above.\n// Effectively Final \u0026#34;message\u0026#34; variable String message = \u0026#34;Thread Started\u0026#34;; // Use in Anonymous Class Thread t1 = new Thread(new Runnable(){ @Override public void run() { System.out.println(message + \u0026#34; in Java7\u0026#34;); } }); t1.start(); // Use in Lambda Expression Thread t2 = new Thread(() -\u0026gt; System.out.println(message + \u0026#34; in Java8\u0026#34;)); t2.start();  Reference:  Baeldung ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/top-java-8-interview-questions/","tags":["Interview Q\u0026A","Java Q\u0026A"],"title":"Java-8 Interview Questions"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll walkthrough JavaScript\u0026rsquo;s Console API methods with quick examples\u0026hellip;\nconsole.log console.log is most frequently used method to log values to the console:\nconst name = \u0026#39;Console!\u0026#39;; console.log(\u0026#39;hello,\u0026#39;, name); //hello, Console! \nWe can also use String Template Literal (wrapped by `` and concat variable values using ${}) as well:\nconsole.log(`hello, ${name}`); //hello, Console! \nWe can also log multiple values in a single statement to the console:\nconst key = \u0026#39;value\u0026#39;; const number = 1; const fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;]; const obj = {a: 1, b: 2}; console.log(\u0026#39;key:\u0026#39;, name, \u0026#39;number:\u0026#39;, number, \u0026#39;fruits:\u0026#39;, fruits, \u0026#39;obj:\u0026#39;, obj); key: Console! number: 1 fruits: (3) [\u0026quot;apple\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;banana\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mango\u0026quot;] obj: {a: 1, b: 2} \nJust like console.log, we have other method to log value to the console:\n console.debug just like console.log with \u0026ldquo;debug\u0026rdquo; log level. Normally browser default log level is info and this won\u0026rsquo;t be displayed until you change log level to debug. console.info just like console.log with \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; log level console.warn prints a warning to the console console.error prints object to the console as an error, and include a stack trace console.debug(\u0026#39;Let me find you\u0026#39;); //won\u0026#39;t be displayed console.info(\u0026#39;Just FYI\u0026#39;); console.warn(\u0026#39;I told you !\u0026#39;); console.error(\u0026#39;I cannot do it.\u0026#39;);  Just FYI ➤ ⚠️ I told you ! ➤ ⓧ I cannot do it.   console.assert You can do some assertion test using console.assert.\nThe first argument is an expression which if evaluate to false, then assertion fails and second argument get printed to the console as an error.\n// this will pass, nothing will be logged console.assert(2 == \u0026#39;2\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;2 not == to \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;\u0026#39;); // this fails, \u0026#39;3 not === to \u0026#34;3\u0026#34;\u0026#39; will be logged console.assert(3 === \u0026#39;3\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;3 not === to \u0026#34;3\u0026#34;\u0026#39;); ➤ ⓧ Assertion failed: 3 not === to \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; You can also pass an object in second argument which is printed when assertion fails:\nconst x = 5; const y = 3; const reason = \u0026#39;x is expected to be less than y\u0026#39;; console.assert(x \u0026lt; y, {x, y, reason}); ➤ ⓧ Assertion failed:  ➤ {x: 5, y: 3, reason: \u0026quot;x is expected to be less than y\u0026quot;} console.clear You can just clear the console using console.clear:\nconsole.clear(); console.count The console.count method is used to count the number of times it has been invoked with the same provided label. For example, here we have two counters, one for even values and one for odd values:\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].forEach(nb =\u0026gt; { if (nb % 2 === 0) { console.count(\u0026#39;even\u0026#39;); } else { console.count(\u0026#39;odd\u0026#39;); } }); odd: 1 even: 1 odd: 2 even: 2 odd: 3 The console.countReset method is used to reset the counter to 1, if we execute below after the above example,\nconsole.countReset(\u0026#39;even\u0026#39;); console.countReset(\u0026#39;odd\u0026#39;); console.count(\u0026#39;even\u0026#39;); console.count(\u0026#39;odd\u0026#39;); even: 1 odd: 1 console.dir You can print all the internal properties of an object in formatted way using console.dir\nWe can print prototype methods of an Array or Object using console.dir,\nconsole.dir([\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;qux\u0026#34;]); //Array  console.dir({a: \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, b: \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;}); //Object ▼ Array(3) 0: \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot; 1: \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot; 2: \u0026quot;qux\u0026quot; length: 3 ▼ __proto__: Array(0) ➤ concat: ƒ concat() ➤ constructor: ƒ Array() ➤ ... ▼ Object a: \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot; b: \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot; ➤ __proto__: Object We can also print scopes and closures of a function using console.dir,\nvar outerFunc = function(c){ var a = 1; var innerFunc = function(d) { var b = 2; return a + b + c + d; } return innerFunc; } console.dir(outerFunc(3)); ▼ ƒ innerFunc(d) arguments: null caller: null length: 1 name: \u0026quot;innerFunc\u0026quot; ➤ prototype: {constructor: ƒ} ➤ __proto__: ƒ () ▼ [[[Scopes]]: Scopes[2] ➤ 0: Closure (outerFunc) {c: 3, a: 1} ➤ 1: Global {parent: Window, opener: null, top: Window, length: 1, frames: Window, …} console.dirxml You can print DOM element in HTML like tree structure using console.dirxml\nconsole.dirxml(document.body); ▼ \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;hello\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; console.dirxml(document.body); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; console.group You can group the log messages together using console.group and console.groupEnd.\nconsole.group(\u0026#34;API Details\u0026#34;); console.log(\u0026#34;Scheme : HTTPS\u0026#34;); console.log(\u0026#34;Host : example.com\u0026#34;); console.groupEnd(); ▼ API Details Scheme : HTTPS Host : example.com \nPlease note that group messages logged using console.group are initially expanded. If you\u0026rsquo;d rather have them collapsed by default, you can use console.groupCollapsed instead:\nconsole.groupCollapsed(\u0026#34;API Details\u0026#34;); console.log(\u0026#34;Scheme : HTTPS\u0026#34;); console.log(\u0026#34;Host : example.com\u0026#34;); console.groupEnd(); ▶ API Details \nYou can further group the messages to the nested levels. That allows you to print hierarchical data to the console in a cleanly formatted manner:\nconsole.group(\u0026#34;API Details\u0026#34;); console.log(\u0026#34;Scheme : HTTPS\u0026#34;); console.log(\u0026#34;Host : example.com\u0026#34;); // nesting  console.group(\u0026#34;User API\u0026#34;); console.log(\u0026#34;Method : GET\u0026#34;); console.log(\u0026#34;Endpoint : /user\u0026#34;); // further nesting  console.group(\u0026#34;Query Parameters\u0026#34;); console.log(\u0026#34;id : 1\u0026#34;); console.groupEnd(); console.groupEnd(); console.groupEnd(); ▼ API Details Scheme : HTTPS Host : example.com ▼ User API Method : GET Endpoint : /user ▼ Query Parameters id : 1 console.table You can print data in tabular format using console.table. This method is quite useful to visualize large objects and arrays.\nvar john = { firstName: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, lastName: \u0026#34;Smith\u0026#34;, age: 41 }; var jane = { firstName: \u0026#34;Jane\u0026#34;, lastName: \u0026#34;Doe\u0026#34;, age: 38 }; var emily = { firstName: \u0026#34;Emily\u0026#34;, lastName: \u0026#34;Jones\u0026#34;, age: 12 }; console.table([john, jane, emily]); ┌─────────┬───────────┬──────────┬─────┐ │ (index) │ firstName │ lastName │ age │ ├─────────┼───────────┼──────────┼─────┤ │ 0 │ 'John' │ 'Smith' │ 41 │ │ 1 │ 'Jane' │ 'Doe' │ 38 │ │ 2 │ 'Emily' │ 'Jones' │ 12 │ └─────────┴───────────┴──────────┴─────┘ ▶ Array(3) \nYou can also choose to print few properties when working with large objects in this way:\nconsole.table([john, jane, emily], [\u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;]); ┌─────────┬───────────┐ │ (index) │ firstName │ ├─────────┼───────────┤ │ 0 │ 'John' │ │ 1 │ 'Jane' │ │ 2 │ 'Emily' │ └─────────┴───────────┘ ▶ Array(3)  Also learn more about console.table() usage in JavaScript\n console.time You can print time taken by a code execution by starting a timer with console.time and ending it with console.timeEnd.\nThe timer can have an optional label, if you use a timer with label then both console.time and console.timeEnd should have same label.\nconsole.time(\u0026#39;fetching data\u0026#39;); fetch(\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users\u0026#39;) .then(d =\u0026gt; d.json()) .then(console.log); console.timeEnd(\u0026#39;fetching data\u0026#39;); fetching data: 0.435791015625ms ▶ (10) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}] console.trace You can use console.trace() to print a stack trace of method execution flow to the console.\n1 const first = () =\u0026gt; { second(); }; 2 const second = () =\u0026gt; { third(); }; 3 const third = () =\u0026gt; { fourth(); }; 4 const fourth = () =\u0026gt; { console.trace(\u0026#34;The trace\u0026#34;); }; 5 first(); You get @ file_name:line_number in console output which you can click on to navigate to the source.\nOutput ▼ The trace fourth @ test:4 third\t@ test:3 second @ test:2 first\t@ test:1 (anonymous) @ test:5 console.log formatting console.log also provide formatting to make our log messages stand out from other messages.

Try to avoid them as there are alternate ways available for debugging, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at them subsequently.\nBrowser as Debugger Most of the modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Safari has built-in support for JavaScript debugging. Chrome as the debugger is generally the first choice among developers.\nChrome Developer Tool  To open DevTool from Chrome\u0026rsquo;s main menu, select More tools ➞ Developer tools.\n    Shortcut keys Mac Windows, Linux, Chrome OS     Elements Tab Command+Option+C Control+Shift+C   Console Tab Command+Option+J Control+Shift+J   Sources Tab Command+Option+I Control+Shift+I     Chrome Developer Tool\n  Some of the most frequently used icons of Chrome DevTools are:-\n Use Inspect icon ⬉ to select an element in the page and inspect its DOM position in Elements Tab. You can update or delete a DOM element, inspect the CSS applied on DOM element, and much more in Elements Tab. Use Device icon ⍇ to check the responsiveness of the website. It adds an additional toolbar on your browser page where you can simulate viewport for different devices, for e.g. mobile phones (such as iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, Nexus, LG, Nokia, Blackberry, etc), tablets (such as iPad etc) and laptops (with or without touch). You can see all JavaScript source code that renders the page, under Sources Tab. Generally source files are minified and it is difficult to understand them and apply breakpoints. Use Format Icon {} to format these minified files in human readable format.  Line-of-code Breakpoint You can use breakpoint to pause your JavaScript code in browser. The most well known type of breakpoint is line-of-code.\nTo set a line-of-code breakpoint in DevTools:\n Click on Sources tab. Open the file and go to the line of code you want to debug. You will see line number column to the left of code. Click on it. An icon appears beside line number to indicate that the breakpoint is set. Click again on same line number if you want to remove breakpoint. Icon disappears.  Please note that the breakpoint icon in DevTool may look different depending upon chrome version and OS (windows or MacOS)\nSometime line-of-code breakpoints can be inefficient to set, especially if you don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly where to look, or if you are working with a large codebase. You can save your time when debugging by knowing how and when to use the other types of breakpoints.\n   Breakpoint Type Use This When You Want To Pause\u0026hellip;     Line-of-code On an exact line of code.   Conditional line-of-code On an exact line of code, but only when some other condition is true.   DOM On the code that changes or removes a specific DOM node, or its children.   XHR On the XHR send() or fetch() method When the request URL contains a string pattern.   Event listener On the code that runs after an event, such as click, is fired.   Exception On the line of code that is throwing a caught or uncaught exception.   Function Whenever a specific function is called.    Set Breakpoint from code using \u0026lsquo;debugger\u0026rsquo; statement When debugger mode is on in the browser and the code execution reaches to debugger; statement, it pause on that line just like line-of-code breakpoint.\nThe debugger statement is quite useful when you want to debug a certain part of your code in browser. Normally you find the buggy code in browser developer tool and set a breakpoint to debug. Sometimes it is not easy to find the code in browser, in that case, you can insert debugger; statement in your source code.\nfunction hello(name) { let phrase = `Hello, ${name}!`; debugger; // \u0026lt;-- the debugger pause on this line  say(phrase); } Conditional Breakpoint You can use a conditional line-of-code breakpoint when you know the exact line of code that you need to investigate, but you want to pause only when some other condition is true.\nTo set a conditional line-of-code breakpoint:\n Click the Sources tab. Open the file and go to the line of code you want to debug. You will see line number column to the left of code. Right-click it. Select Edit breakpoint.., A dialog displays underneath the line of code. Enter your condition in the dialog. Press Enter to activate the breakpoint.  You see that icon for conditional breakpoint is different from simple line-of-code breakpoint. Breakpoint icon in DevTool may look different depending upon chrome version and OS (windows or MacOS)\n Chrome DevTool Conditional Breakpoint\n  DOM Change Breakpoint Use a DOM change breakpoint when you want to pause on the code that changes a DOM node or its children.\nTo set a DOM change breakpoint:\n Click the Elements tab. Go the element that you want to set the breakpoint on. Right-click the element. Hover over Break on then select Subtree modifications, Attribute modifications, or Node removal.  Types of DOM change breakpoints  Subtree modifications: Triggered when a child of the currently-selected node is removed or added, or the contents of a child are changed. Not triggered on child node attribute changes, or on any changes to the currently-selected node. Attributes modifications: Triggered when an attribute is added or removed on the currently-selected node, or when an attribute value changes. Node Removal: Triggered when the currently-selected node is removed.  XHR/Fetch Breakpoint If you encounter an error in AJAX request and you are not able to identify the code which is submitting this request, then XHR breakpoint is very useful to quickly find the AJAX source code.\nXHR breakpoint pause the execution of code when the request URL of an AJAX request contains a specified string. XHR breakpoint is supported for AJAX send() and fetch() methods.\nTo set an XHR breakpoint:\n Click the Sources tab. Expand the XHR Breakpoints pane. Click Add breakpoint. Enter the string which you want to break on. DevTools pauses when this string is present anywhere in an XHR\u0026rsquo;s request URL. Press Enter to confirm.  Event listener Breakpoint Use event listener breakpoints when you want to pause on the event listener code that runs after an event is fired. You can select specific events, such as click under mouse events, or all events, such as cut, copy, paste under clipboard category.\nTo turn on event listener breakpoint:\n Click the Sources tab. Expand the Event Listener Breakpoints pane. DevTools shows a list of event categories, such as Animation, Canvas, Clipboard, Mouse, etc. Either check ☑ category to include all events under that category, or expand the category and check ☑ a specific event.  Exception Breakpoint The Chrome Developer Tools allows you to pause execution of your JavaScript code upon throwing a caught or uncaught exception. This is particularly useful when your code is not throwing error and failing silently. This makes it possible for you to inspect the state of your application at the time when the Error object was created.\nTo turn on exception breakpoint:\n Click the Sources tab. Click Pause on exceptions icon. It turns blue when enabled. Check ☑ Pause on uncaught exceptions if you want to pause execution on caught exceptions as well. Remember to turn them off when done.   Chrome DevTool XHR, Event Listener and Exception Breakpoints\n  Function Breakpoint Call debug(functionName), where functionName is the function you want to debug, when you want to pause whenever a specific function is called. You can insert debug() into your code (like a console.log() statement) or call it from the DevTools Console. debug() is equivalent to setting a line-of-code breakpoint on the first line of the function.\nMake sure the target function is in scope. DevTools throws a ReferenceError if the function you want to debug is not in scope.\nfunction sum(a, b) { let result = a + b; // DevTools pauses on this line.  return result; } debug(sum); // Pass the function object, not a string. sum(); Blackbox Script files When you debug your application code in Chrome DevTool and step through your code line-by-line, the debugger sometimes jumps into a source file that\u0026rsquo;s not your focus (such as a third-party JS library). I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026rsquo;ve experienced the annoyance of stepping through the library code before getting back to your own application code.\nThe Chrome DevTool provides an ability to blackbox JavaScript file(s) so that debugger will not jump into those files and ignore them when stepping through code you\u0026rsquo;re debugging.\nWhat happens when you blackbox a script?  Exceptions thrown from library code will not pause (if Pause on exceptions is enabled), Stepping into/out/over bypasses the library code, Event listener breakpoints don\u0026rsquo;t break in library code, The debugger will not pause on any breakpoints set in library code.  The end result is you are debugging your application code instead of third party resources. To blackbox JavaScript files:\n Click on Main Menu \u0026gt; Settings icon OR use F1 shortcut key to open settings Click on Blackboxing menu item. Click on Add Pattern\u0026hellip; button. Enter file name or pattern in text box and click Add button. Check ☑ Blackbox content script to enable blackboxing.   Chrome DevTool Blackbox Script\n  Snippets Generally we use browser console to execute and test some code snippets. Sometime, we need to test same code again and again. The Chrome DevTools provides the ability to save code snippets for future use.\nTo save your code snippet:\n Click the Sources tab. In the left panel of Sources Tab, Click on the Snippets sub-tab. Click on + New Snippet to create a new file to save your code snippet. When you open a snippet code. There are icons to format and execute your code.  You can use snippets to store your frequently used debugging code scripts, made by you or other developers. Paul Irish has written some useful snippets - stopBefore.js, Grep.js which you can copy in your DevTool snippets. Snippets are accessible from console. Let\u0026rsquo;s go through them:-\n The storeBefore.js snippet allows to setup a breakpoint that is triggered just before a certain function is called. For example, this will trigger a breakpoint just before the document.getElementById function is called: stopBefore(document, \u0026#39;getElementById\u0026#39;)  The grep.js snippet allows searching an object and its prototypical chain for properties that match a given search criteria. For example this instruction will search for all properties matching get in the document object: grep(document, \u0026#39;get\u0026#39;);  The debugAccess.js snippet allows to trigger a breakpoint when a given property is accessed. For example this will trigger a breakpoint each time document.cookie is called: debugAccess(document, \u0026#39;cookie\u0026#39;);   Print Multiple Values Most of the developers use console.log() for debugging values in browser console. It is a king of debugging and this solves most of your debugging problems.\nThe thing you might not know is, console.log() can print multiple values by providing comma-separated values so you don\u0026rsquo;t need to concat values yourself.\nEach comma \u0026quot;,\u0026quot; add a space between values.\nlet x = 1; console.log(\u0026#39;x =\u0026#39;, x); let y = \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;; let fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;]; var obj = {a: 1, b: 2}; console.log(\u0026#39;x =\u0026#39;, x, \u0026#39;y =\u0026#39;, y, \u0026#39;fruits =\u0026#39;, fruits, \u0026#39;obj =\u0026#39;, obj); Output x = 1 x = 1 y = hello fruits = (3) [\u0026quot;apple\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;banana\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mango\u0026quot;] obj = {a: 1, b: 2} You can also use Template Literal to combining multiple values in single string like this\nconsole.log(`x = ${x}, y = ${y}, fruits = ${fruits}, obj = ${obj}`); Avoid logging Object Reference  Don\u0026rsquo;t use console.log(obj), use console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))) instead.\n When you log an array (or object) using console.log() and update it afterward. Many browsers show you the latest state of the array (or object) which might be misleading.\nLogging using console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))) make sure, you are printing a copy of array (or object) which will log the exact state at the time of printing.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s understand this from below array example,\nlet fruits = [\u0026#39;apple\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;banana\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mango\u0026#39;]; console.log(fruits); console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(fruits))); //makes a copy of it  fruits.push(\u0026#39;grapes\u0026#39;); Output ▼ (3) [\u0026quot;apple\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;banana\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mango\u0026quot;] 0: \u0026quot;apple\u0026quot; 1: \u0026quot;banana\u0026quot; 2: \u0026quot;mango\u0026quot; 3: \u0026quot;grapes\u0026quot; length: 4 ➤ __proto__: Array(0) ▼ (3) [\u0026quot;apple\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;banana\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mango\u0026quot;] 0: \u0026quot;apple\u0026quot; 1: \u0026quot;banana\u0026quot; 2: \u0026quot;mango\u0026quot; length: 3 ➤ __proto__: Array(0) We see that console.log() showing the latest state of array with length 4 whereas its length was 3 at the time of logging.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s also look at object example,\nlet person = { name: \u0026#39;adam\u0026#39;, age: 21, gender: \u0026#39;male\u0026#39; }; console.log(person); console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))); //makes a copy of it  person.married = \u0026#39;NO\u0026#39;; Output ▼ {name: \u0026quot;adam\u0026quot;, age: 21, gender: \u0026quot;male\u0026quot;} age: 21 gender: \u0026quot;male\u0026quot; married: \u0026quot;NO\u0026quot; name: \u0026quot;adam\u0026quot; ➤ __proto__: Object ▼ {name: \u0026quot;adam\u0026quot;, age: 21, gender: \u0026quot;male\u0026quot;} age: 21 gender: \u0026quot;male\u0026quot; name: \u0026quot;adam\u0026quot; ➤ __proto__: Object We see that console.log() showing the latest state of object including married field which was missing at the time of logging.\nPrint DOM element in JSON format DOM elements are printed as HTML elements tree structure using console.log(). Instead, we can use console.dir() to see DOM elements in JSON like tree structure.\nconsole.log(document.body); console.dir(document.body);  Print Constructor function\u0026rsquo;s Prototype Methods The console.dir() is quite useful to print constructor function\u0026rsquo;s internal properties such as prototype methods.\nWe see in below example that console.log() just print the name of constructor function whereas, using console.dir(), we\u0026rsquo;re able to see all prototype methods of Array function.\nconsole.log(Array); console.dir(Array); Output ƒ Array() { [native code] } ▼ ƒ Array() arguments: (...) caller: (...) length: 1 name: \u0026quot;Array\u0026quot; ▼ prototype: ƒ () length: 0 ➤ constructor: ƒ Array() ➤ concat: ƒ concat() ➤ find: ƒ find() ➤ findIndex: ƒ findIndex() ➤ lastIndexOf: ƒ lastIndexOf() ➤ pop: ƒ pop() ➤ push: ƒ push() ➤ reverse: ƒ reverse() ➤ slice: ƒ slice() ➤ sort: ƒ sort() ➤ splice: ƒ splice() ➤ includes: ƒ includes() ➤ indexOf: ƒ indexOf() ➤ join: ƒ join() ➤ toString: ƒ toString() ... Print Function\u0026rsquo;s Closure The console.dir() is quite useful to print function\u0026rsquo;s internal properties such as scopes and closures.\nWe see in below example that console.log() just print the function\u0026rsquo;s signature, using console.dir(), we’re able to see the prototype methods, scopes and most importantly closures of the function.\nvar outerFunc = function(c){ var a = 1; var innerFunc = function(d) { var b = 2; var innerMostFunc = function(e) { return a + b + c + d + e; } return innerMostFunc; } return innerFunc; } // print innerMostFunc console.log(outerFunc(3)(4)); console.dir(outerFunc(3)(4)); Output ƒ (e) { return a + b + c + d + e; } ▼ ƒ innerMostFunc(c) length: 1 name: \u0026quot;innerMostFunc\u0026quot; arguments: null caller: null ➤ prototype: {constructor: ƒ} ➤ __proto__: ƒ () [[FunctionLocation]]: ▼ [[Scopes]]: Scopes[3] ➤ 0: Closure (innerFunc) {d: 4, b: 2} ➤ 1: Closure (outerFunc) {c: 3, a: 1} ➤ 2: Global {parent: Window, opener: null, top: Window, length: 1, frames: Window, …} Print Object\u0026rsquo;s internal properties Some of the browsers print a stringify version of object when use console.log() whereas prints object JSON tree when use console.dir(). There is not much difference in printing in advance browsers such as chrome where both methods print object JSON tree.\nvar obj = {a: 1, b: 2}; console.log(obj); console.dir(obj); We see that nothing much different when print object using both methods in chrome browser,\nOutput ▼ {a: 1, b: 2} a: 1 b: 2 ➤ __proto__: Object ▼ Object a: 1 b: 2 ➤ __proto__: Object Print Objects as Table The console.table() method is quite useful to print a large set of data in tabular format to visualize it easily. This method also provides the ability to print a few fields out of those large data sets. When rendered in browser as a table, browser provides the ability to sort the columns of the table.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the example where we are logging a large JSON in tabular format,\nvar personDetails = [ { \u0026#34;_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;5edbbb78633118f455e877fb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;index\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;guid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;30dd1d2c-5083-4165-8580-5ae734cd0d12\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;isActive\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;balance\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$1,778.03\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;picture\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://placehold.it/32x32\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: 26, \u0026#34;eyeColor\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Anderson\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;last\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Sargent\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;company\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MAZUDA\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;anderson.sargent@mazuda.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;phone\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;+1 (839) 437-3851\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;address\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;235 Ashland Place, Chautauqua, Minnesota, 3487\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;about\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Pariatur nisi cillum culpa aliquip mollit veniam.

Few pointers:-\n console.time() and console.timeEnd() methods should have same labels. You can also set up multiple timers by assigning different labels to the method. console.time() and console.timeEnd() are part of the Console API (just like console.log())  Let’s see how it works:\nconsole.time(\u0026#39;Timer1\u0026#39;); console.time(\u0026#39;Timer2\u0026#39;); var items = []; for(var i = 0; i \u0026lt; 100000; i++){ items.push({index: i}); } console.timeEnd(\u0026#39;Timer1\u0026#39;); for(var j = 0; j \u0026lt; 100000; j++){ items.push({index: j}); } console.timeEnd(\u0026#39;Timer2\u0026#39;); Output Timer1: 13.088134765625ms Timer2: 26.070517578125ms Print Stack trace of Method Execution You can use console.trace() to print a stack trace of method execution flow to the console. Few pointers:-\n console.trace() is compatible with the snippets feature of Chrome DevTools. console.trace() is part of the Console API (just like console.log())  Let’s see how it works:\n1 const first = () =\u0026gt; { second(); }; 2 const second = () =\u0026gt; { third(); }; 3 const third = () =\u0026gt; { fourth(); }; 4 const fourth = () =\u0026gt; { console.trace(\u0026#34;The trace\u0026#34;); }; 5 first(); You get @ file_name:line_number in console output which you can click on to navigate to the source.\nOutput ▼ The trace fourth @ test:4 third\t@ test:3 second @ test:2 first\t@ test:1 (anonymous) @ test:5 Use a Unit Testing Framework There are many third-party unit-testing framework for JavaScript available with their own philosophy and syntax. Here are most widely used JavaScript testing frameworks:-\n Mocha is feature-rich framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. JEST is popular framework maintained by Facebook. It is a preferred framework for the React based applications as it requires zero configuration. It works great with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node, React, Angular, and Vue. Jasmine is a behavior-driven testing framework. It has no external dependencies. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests. QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework. It\u0026rsquo;s used by the jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects and is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code  \nThanks for reading till the end. I hope this tutorial would have helped you to find some useful tips for debugging and logging to the console, which you\u0026rsquo;d not known before.\nReference:\n Google Developers Chrome DevTool ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/debugging-tips-and-tricks/","tags":["Javascript Console"],"title":"JavaScript Debugging Tips and Tricks"},{"categories":["Hugo"],"contents":"In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to setup client side search engine for Hugo Website without any backend server or additional build steps required.\nOverview When you generate a website using Hugo static site generator. You write your pages generally in markdown (.md files) so all your content lies in the markdown files.\nWe are going to follow these steps to create our search engine:-\n Update config.toml file to instruct Hugo to generate JSON file of entire website content Create layouts/_default/index.json to provide a template to Hugo for generating a index.json file Create static/js/search.js to use Fuse.js for searching content out of this JSON file Create content/search.md to serve a page for /search URL Create layouts/_default/search.html to provide a template to render your search page results  Follow the steps:- Update config.toml Hugo provide out of the box support to generate content in multiple formats including JSON. All we need to do is to tell Hugo that we want to generate index.json file for entire website content.\nAdd the following snippet in config.toml file to instruct Hugo to generate JSON output along with HTML and RSS default outputs:\nconfig.toml ... [outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RSS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;] \nCreate layouts/_default/index.json Once we instruct Hugo to generate index.json file, Hugo looks for the template to generate file. Add the following index.json template to specified folder:\nlayouts/_default/index.json {{- $.Scratch.Add \u0026quot;index\u0026quot; slice -}} {{- range .Site.RegularPages -}} {{- $.Scratch.Add \u0026quot;index\u0026quot; (dict \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; .Title \u0026quot;tags\u0026quot; .Params.tags \u0026quot;categories\u0026quot; .Params.categories \u0026quot;contents\u0026quot; .Plain \u0026quot;permalink\u0026quot; .Permalink) -}} {{- end -}} {{- $.Scratch.Get \u0026quot;index\u0026quot; | jsonify -}} \nCreate search.js Now create a search.js file which uses jquery, fuse.js, and mark.js to parse generated index.json file, and return matching content, with highlighting.\nPlease note that initial part of the code in search.js provide config:-\n summaryInclude: Number of pages to show in search result fuseOptions: keys is important parameter where you can increase the weight of title, contents, tags or categories values to give them high priority in matching the content in search results.  static/js/search.js summaryInclude=60; var fuseOptions = { shouldSort: true, includeMatches: true, threshold: 0.0, tokenize:true, location: 0, distance: 100, maxPatternLength: 32, minMatchCharLength: 1, keys: [ {name:\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;,weight:0.8}, {name:\u0026#34;contents\u0026#34;,weight:0.5}, {name:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;,weight:0.3}, {name:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;,weight:0.3} ] }; var searchQuery = param(\u0026#34;s\u0026#34;); if(searchQuery){ $(\u0026#34;#search-query\u0026#34;).val(searchQuery); executeSearch(searchQuery); }else { $(\u0026#39;#search-results\u0026#39;).append(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Please enter a word or phrase above\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026#34;); } function executeSearch(searchQuery){ $.getJSON( \u0026#34;/index.json\u0026#34;, function( data ) { var pages = data; var fuse = new Fuse(pages, fuseOptions); var result = fuse.search(searchQuery); console.log({\u0026#34;matches\u0026#34;:result}); if(result.length \u0026gt; 0){ populateResults(result); }else{ $(\u0026#39;#search-results\u0026#39;).append(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;No matches found\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026#34;); } }); } function populateResults(result){ $.each(result,function(key,value){ var contents= value.item.contents; var snippet = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; var snippetHighlights=[]; var tags =[]; if( fuseOptions.tokenize ){ snippetHighlights.push(searchQuery); }else{ $.each(value.matches,function(matchKey,mvalue){ if(mvalue.key == \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; || mvalue.key == \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34; ){ snippetHighlights.push(mvalue.value); }else if(mvalue.key == \u0026#34;contents\u0026#34;){ start = mvalue.indices[0][0]-summaryInclude\u0026gt;0?mvalue.indices[0][0]-summaryInclude:0; end = mvalue.indices[0][1]+summaryInclude\u0026lt;contents.length?mvalue.indices[0][1]+summaryInclude:contents.length; snippet += contents.substring(start,end); snippetHighlights.push(mvalue.value.substring(mvalue.indices[0][0],mvalue.indices[0][1]-mvalue.indices[0][0]+1)); } }); } if(snippet.length\u0026lt;1){ snippet += contents.substring(0,summaryInclude*2); } //pull template from hugo templarte definition  var templateDefinition = $(\u0026#39;#search-result-template\u0026#39;).html(); //replace values  var output = render(templateDefinition,{key:key,title:value.item.title,link:value.item.permalink,tags:value.item.tags,categories:value.item.categories,snippet:snippet}); $(\u0026#39;#search-results\u0026#39;).append(output); $.each(snippetHighlights,function(snipkey,snipvalue){ $(\u0026#34;#summary-\u0026#34;+key).mark(snipvalue); }); }); } function param(name) { return decodeURIComponent((location.search.split(name + \u0026#39;=\u0026#39;)[1] || \u0026#39;\u0026#39;).split(\u0026#39;\u0026amp;\u0026#39;)[0]).replace(/\\+/g, \u0026#39; \u0026#39;); } function render(templateString, data) { var conditionalMatches,conditionalPattern,copy; conditionalPattern = /\\$\\{\\s*isset ([a-zA-Z]*) \\s*\\}(.*)\\$\\{\\s*end\\s*}/g; //since loop below depends on re.lastInxdex, we use a copy to capture any manipulations whilst inside the loop  copy = templateString; while ((conditionalMatches = conditionalPattern.exec(templateString)) !== null) { if(data[conditionalMatches[1]]){ //valid key, remove conditionals, leave contents.  copy = copy.replace(conditionalMatches[0],conditionalMatches[2]); }else{ //not valid, remove entire section  copy = copy.replace(conditionalMatches[0],\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); } } templateString = copy; //now any conditionals removed we can do simple substitution  var key, find, re; for (key in data) { find = \u0026#39;\\\\$\\\\{\\\\s*\u0026#39; + key + \u0026#39;\\\\s*\\\\}\u0026#39;; re = new RegExp(find, \u0026#39;g\u0026#39;); templateString = templateString.replace(re, data[key]); } return templateString; } \nCreate content/search.md Create search.md to create a page solely to respond to /search URL. No content from this page is rendered. As we have defined the front-matter layout as \u0026ldquo;search\u0026rdquo;, content is rendered on this page is from template layouts/_default/search.html\ncontent/search.md --- title: \u0026quot;Search Results\u0026quot; sitemap: priority : 0.1 layout: \u0026quot;search\u0026quot; --- Nothing on this page will be visible. This file exists solely to respond to /search URL.

It falls under the category of Creational Design Patterns.\nOverview Analogy As the name suggests, Factory Design Pattern is based on real time Factory concept. As we know that factory manufactures products as per the requirements. It does not expose the internal details of manufacturing. Also, in case of requirements for newer products, it manufactures them as well.\nSimilarly, Factory Design Pattern enables us to create objects using a factory class without exposing the creation logic to the client and thus providing abstraction with flexibility to extension.\nWhen a client needs an object it asks the factory for it by providing some information on the type of object it requires. Factory method in factory class acts as a single place to create the objects from concrete classes based on the client\u0026rsquo;s input and return them as objects of interface or abstract types.\nVirtual Constructor This pattern replaces the direct object construction calls (using new operator) from client with calls to factory method. Since it replaces direct constructor calls, it is also known as Virtual Constructor.\nGoF Design Patterns According to GoF (Gangs of Four) Design Patterns,\n Factory Design Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.\n When to use Factory Design Pattern?  When we need to create objects of types which may be sub-classed. When client needs to create an object based on some input parameter and need not know how the object is created Also, a good choice when we don’t know the exact types before hand when starting on a project. This would provide ease to extensibility.  How to implement Factory Design Pattern?  Create a super class (an interface) Create sub class(es) (requirement based):  Concrete A Concrete B Concrete C   Factory Class with factory method that accepts some input parameter (to decide the type of object) to return the required object as object of interface Create an Enum that would be used to define types based on which factory method would create an object of concrete class Client code(main class) which creates an object using factory method of factory class by providing some input parameter and then use it  Code Example Now we know what are the classes required to build a Factory Design Pattern.\n   Let\u0026rsquo;s first create an interface named Currency\npublic interface Currency { String getCode(); String getSign(); }   Create concrete classes Rupee, SGDollar, and USDollar implementing Currency interface\npublic class Rupee implements Currency { @Override public String getCode() { return \u0026#34;INR\u0026#34;; } @Override public String getSign() { return \u0026#34;₹\u0026#34;; } } public class SGDollar implements Currency { @Override public String getCode() { return \u0026#34;SGD\u0026#34;; } @Override public String getSign() { return \u0026#34;S$\u0026#34;; } } public class USDollar implements Currency { @Override public String getCode() { return \u0026#34;USD\u0026#34;; } @Override public String getSign() { return \u0026#34;$\u0026#34;; } }   Create an Enum Country for input parameter to factory method\npublic enum Country { INDIA, SINGAPORE, USA, CANADA }   Finally create a factory class CurrencyFactory\npublic class CurrencyFactory { public static Currency createCurrency(String country) { if(country.equalsIgnoreCase(Country.SINGAPORE.toString())) { return new SGDollar(); } else if(country.equalsIgnoreCase(Country.INDIA.toString()) { return new Rupee(); } else if(country.equalsIgnoreCase(Country.USA.toString())) { return new USDollar(); } throw new IllegalArgumentException(String.format(\u0026#34;No currency found for \u0026#39;%s\u0026#39;\u0026#34;, country)); } }   Let\u0026rsquo;s create a Client (Main Class) to test our Factory\npublic class Client { public static void main(String [] args) { Currency indiaCurrency = CurrencyFactory.createCurrency(Country.INDIA.toString()); Currency singaporeCurrency = CurrencyFactory.createCurrency(Country.SINGAPORE.toString()); Currency usaCurrency = CurrencyFactory.createCurrency(Country.USA.toString()); //Currency canadaCurrency = CurrencyFactory.createCurrency(Country.CANADA.toString());  //Exception in thread \u0026#34;main\u0026#34; java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No currency found for \u0026#39;CANADA\u0026#39;  System.out.println(indiaCurrency.getCode()); System.out.println(indiaCurrency.getSign()); System.out.println(singaporeCurrency.getCode()); System.out.println(singaporeCurrency.getSign()); System.out.println(usaCurrency.getCode()); System.out.println(usaCurrency.getSign()); } } Output INR ₹ SGD S$ USD $   Advantages of Factory Design Pattern  Loose Coupling: Introduces loose coupling between classes. Hence, involves programming against abstract entities rather than concrete implementations. Encapsulation: Good approach to encapsulation. Factory method used to create different objects from factory encapsulates the object creation code. Abstraction: Provides abstraction between implementation and client classes through inheritance. Single Responsibility Principle: Object creation is done at one place and this separates out the object creation code from actual usage. Any changes in object creation in future would require change in only place. Open/Closed Principle: Further to extend the functionality of factory to support newer type would be a small change i.e. adding a new subclass and corresponding object creation logic in factory method.

We can have a size counter initialized as zero. Increase or decrease the counter by 1, on addition or deletion of nodes from linked list respectively.\nIn this case, middle element\u0026rsquo;s index will be (size-1)/2\nclass LinkedList\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { Node\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; head = null; int size = 0; public Node\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; get(int index) { Node\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; node = head; // get by index \treturn node; } public void add(T t) { // add element \tsize++; } public void delete(int index) { // delete element \tsize--; } public void findMiddleElement() { get((size - 1) / 2); } } \nApproach 2: Traverse the LinkedList to find size Sometime we have given only the head node of the linked list and no information about the size.\nIn simplest approach, we can traverse through whole linked list starting from head till end to find the size of the linked list.\nIn this case, middle element\u0026rsquo;s index will be (size()-1)/2\nclass LinkedList\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { Node\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; head = null; public Node\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; get(int index) { Node\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; node = head; // get by index \treturn node; } public int size() { Node\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; node = head; int size = 1; while (node.getNext() != null) { node = node.getNext(); size++; } return size; } public void findMiddleElement() { get((size() - 1) / 2); } } If linked list is having n elements, then this approach requires n iteration to get size and n/2 iteration to get middle elements.\nTotal iteration is (n + n/2)\n\nApproach 3: Fast and Slow pointers This approach is also applicable when size of the linked list is unknown and only head node is given.\nIn this approach, we iterate through the linked list using two pointers. Fast pointer jumps 2 nodes in each iteration, and the slow pointer jumps only one node per iteration.\nWhen the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle element.\nclass LinkedList\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { Node\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; head = null; public Node\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; findMiddleElement() { Node\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; slow = head; Node\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; fast = head; while (fast != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; fast.getNext() != null) { fast = fast.getNext().getNext(); slow = slow.getNext(); } return slow; } } This is best approach when size is unknown as we are able to find the middle elements in just n/2 iterations.\n\nSummary We learned that it is always good to keep track of linked list size to find the middle element.

Spring boot will intialize the fields of PersonConfig with values from .yml file prefixed with \u0026ldquo;person\u0026rdquo; property for e.g. PersonConfig\u0026rsquo;s name field value will be initialized from \u0026ldquo;person.name\u0026rdquo; property.\nRelaxed Binding Spring Boot @ConfigurationProperties annotation supports relaxed binding which means that\nperson.fav-num person.favNum person.fav_num person.FAV_NUM Any of the above .yml property format can be mapped to PersonConfig\u0026rsquo;s favNum field.\nSummary In this article, we learned that Spring Boot configuration using .yml file is much simpler as compared to .properties file. If we compare .yml file of above example with .properties file.

Regex to match Phone Number of All Country Formats Before we start defining a regex, let\u0026rsquo;s look at some of the country phone number formats:-\nAbkhazia +995 442 123456 Afghanistan +93 30 539-0605 Australia +61 2 1255-3456 China +86 (20) 1255-3456 Germany +49 351 125-3456 Indonesia +62 21 6539-0605 Iran +98 (515) 539-0605 Italy +39 06 5398-0605 New Zealand +64 3 539-0605 Philippines +63 35 539-0605 Singapore +65 6396 0605 Thailand +66 2 123 4567 UK +44 141 222-3344 USA +1 (212) 555-3456 Vietnam +84 35 539-0605 Let\u0026rsquo;s extract some information from these numbers:-\n Country Code prefix starts with \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo; and has 1 to 3 digits Last part of the number, also known as subscriber number is 4 digits in all of the numbers Most of the countries have 10 digits phone number after excluding country code. A general observation is that all countries phone number falls somewhere between 8 to 11 digits after excluding country code.  Let\u0026rsquo;s see again on regex from previous example to validate country code:\nString countryCodeRegex = \u0026#34;^(\\\\+\\\\d{1,3}( )?)?((\\\\(\\\\d{3}\\\\))|\\\\d{3})[- .]?\\\\d{3}[- .]?\\\\d{4}$\u0026#34;l The above regex is to match 10 digit phone numbers, Let\u0026rsquo;s make some changes in this and make it more flexible to match 8 to 11 digits phone numbers:-\nRegex to Match All Country Formats String allCountryRegex = \u0026#34;^(\\\\+\\\\d{1,3}( )?)?((\\\\(\\\\d{1,3}\\\\))|\\\\d{1,3})[- .]?\\\\d{3,4}[- .]?\\\\d{4}$\u0026#34;; Let\u0026rsquo;s break the regex and understand,\n ^ start of expression (\\\\+\\\\d{1,3}( )?)? is optional match of country code between 1 to 3 digits prefixed with \u0026lsquo;+\u0026rsquo; symbol, followed by space or no space. ((\\\\(\\\\d{1,3}\\\\))|\\\\d{1,3} is mandatory group of 1 to 3 digits with or without parenthesis followed by hyphen, space or no space. \\\\d{3,4}[- .]? is mandatory group of 3 or 4 digits followed by hyphen, space or no space \\\\d{4} is mandatory group of last 4 digits $ end of expression\n  6. Regex to match Phone Number of Specific Country Format As you saw in the previous example that we have to add some flexibility in our regex to match all countries' formats. If you want more strict validation of specific country format then here are examples of India and Singapore Phone number regex pattern:\nString indiaRegex = \u0026#34;^(\\\\+\\\\d{2}( )?)?((\\\\(\\\\d{3}\\\\))|\\\\d{3})[- .]?\\\\d{3}[- .]?\\\\d{4}$\u0026#34;; String singaporeRegex = \u0026#34;^(\\\\+\\\\d{2}( )?)?\\\\d{4}[- .]?\\\\d{4}$\u0026#34;; ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/java/java-regex-to-validate-phone-number/","tags":["Java Regex","Java String"],"title":"Java Regex to Validate Phone Number"},{"categories":["Spring Boot"],"contents":"This article demonstrate use of Spring @Value annotation with Primitives, Default value, Dates, List, Map, System Properties, Constructor Injection, Setter Injection, and Methods\u0026hellip;\nThis annotation is used for injecting values into fields in Spring-managed beans and its value typically comes from property files (.properties and .yml files), system properties and environment variables.\n1. Using @Value with Primitives application.properties\ncourse.title = \u0026quot;How to use Spring @Value annotation\u0026quot; course.duration = 30 course.rating = 4.5 course.page_views = 1e+10 course.trending = true We can set the values of primitive fields such as String, int, float, double and boolean from property file as below:-\n@Value(\u0026#34;${course.title}\u0026#34;) private String title; @Value(\u0026#34;${course.duration}\u0026#34;) private int duration; @Value(\u0026#34;${course.rating}\u0026#34;) private float rating; @Value(\u0026#34;${course.page_views}\u0026#34;) private double pageViews; @Value(\u0026#34;${course.trending}\u0026#34;) private boolean trending; \n2. Using @Value with Default value Default values can be provided for properties that might not be defined. In below example the property course.review is not defined so review field will be initialized with default value i.e. “No Reviews Yet”.\n// @Value(\u0026#34;${property: defaultValue}\u0026#34;) @Value(\u0026#34;${course.review: No Reviews Yet}\u0026#34;) private String review; \n3. Using @Value with Dates application.properties\ncourse.created_date = 2020-05-26 There is no direct support to initialize a LocalDate field using @Value annotation. We need to use SpEL (Spring Expression Language) to initialize LocalDate field by parsing a String property:\n// SpEL expression used to initialize a Date @Value(\u0026#34;#{T(java.time.LocalDate).parse(\u0026#39;${course.created_date}\u0026#39;)}\u0026#34;) private LocalDate createdDate; \n4. Using @Value with List application.properties\ncourse.tags = Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Annotation Any property having comma separated values can be initialized as a List using @Value annotation in latest version of Spring.\n// Comma separated property values auto initialize a List @Value(\u0026#34;${course.tags}\u0026#34;) private List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; tags; If you are using old version of Spring, require SpEL expression to initialize a List:\n@Value(\u0026#34;#{\u0026#39;${course.tags}\u0026#39;.split(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;)}\u0026#34;) private List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; tags; SpEl expression can also be used to get specific value from comma separated values:\n@Value(\u0026#34;#{\u0026#39;${course.tags}\u0026#39;.split(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;)[0]}\u0026#34;) private String firstTag; \n5. Using @Value with Map application.properties\ncourse.keyword_count = { 'keyword1': '12', 'keyword2': '44', 'keyword3': '85', 'keyword4': '100'} Note: the keys and values in the property Map must be in single quotes.\nWe can initialize a Map using above property using SpEL expression inside @Value annotation\n// SpEL expression used to initialize a Map @Value(\u0026#34;#{${course.keyword_count}}\u0026#34;) private Map\u0026lt;String, Integer\u0026gt; keywordCountMap; If we need to get the value of a specific key in the Map, all we have to do is add the key\u0026rsquo;s name in the expression:\nWe can use any one out of these two ways:-\n// way 1 - .key @Value(\u0026#34;#{${course.keyword_count}.keyword1}\u0026#34;) private Integer FirstKeywordCount; // way 2 - [\u0026#39;key\u0026#39;] @Value(\u0026#34;#{${course.keyword_count}[\u0026#39;keyword2\u0026#39;]}\u0026#34;) private Integer SecondKeywordCount; If we\u0026rsquo;re not sure whether the Map contains a certain key, we should choose a safer expression that will not throw an exception but set the value to null when the key is not found:\n@Value(\u0026#34;#{${course.keyword_count}[\u0026#39;unknownKey\u0026#39;]}\u0026#34;) private Integer unknownKeywordCount; We can also set default values for the properties or keys that might not exist:\n@Value(\u0026#34;#{${unknownMap : {key1: \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;, key2: \u0026#39;2\u0026#39;}}}\u0026#34;) private Map\u0026lt;String, Integer\u0026gt; unknownMap; @Value(\u0026#34;#{${course.keyword_count}[\u0026#39;unknownKey\u0026#39;] ?: 100}\u0026#34;) private Integer unknownKeyWithDefaultValue; Map entries can also be filtered before injection. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume we need to get only those entries whose keyword count is greater than 50:\n@Value(\u0026#34;#{${course.keyword_count}.?[value \u0026gt; \u0026#39;50\u0026#39;]}\u0026#34;) private Map\u0026lt;String, Integer\u0026gt; keywordCountMapFiltered; \n6. Using @Value with System Properties You can use @Value annotation for System properties similar to as they were defined in property file. Example of System Properties are as below\n//UTF-8 @Value(\u0026#34;${file.encoding}\u0026#34;) private String fileEncoding; //Mac OS X @Value(\u0026#34;${os.name}\u0026#34;) private String osName; // /Users/ashishkumarlahoti @Value(\u0026#34;${user.home}\u0026#34;) private String userHome We can also use the @Value annotation to inject all current system properties:\n@Value(\u0026#34;#{systemProperties}\u0026#34;) private Map\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; systemPropertiesMap; We can also use SpEL expressions to get the value from System Property Map:\n// /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_211.jdk/Contents/Home/jre @Value(\u0026#34;#{systemProperties[\u0026#39;java.home\u0026#39;]}\u0026#34;) private String javaHome; //Oracle Corporation @Value(\u0026#34;#{systemProperties[\u0026#39;java.vendor\u0026#39;]}\u0026#34;) private String javaVendor; We can also initialize some default value if System property is not available:\n@Value(\u0026#34;#{systemProperties[\u0026#39;unknown\u0026#39;] ?: \u0026#39;Default Value\u0026#39;}\u0026#34;) private String unknownSystemProperty; \n7. Using @Value with Constructor Injection When we use the @Value annotation, we\u0026rsquo;re not limited to a field injection. We can also use it together with constructor injection.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see this in practice:\n@Component @PropertySource(\u0026#34;classpath:values.properties\u0026#34;) public class PriorityProvider { private String priority; @Autowired public PriorityProvider(@Value(\u0026#34;${priority:normal}\u0026#34;) String priority) { this.priority = priority; } // getter setter } In the above example, we inject a priority directly into our PriorityProvider‘s constructor.\nNote, we also provide a default value in case the property isn\u0026rsquo;t found.\n\n8. Using @Value with Setter Injection Similar to constructor injection, we can also use @Value with setter injection.\n@Component @PropertySource(\u0026#34;classpath:values.properties\u0026#34;) public class CollectionProvider { private List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; values = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); @Autowired public void setValues(@Value(\u0026#34;#{\u0026#39;${listOfValues}\u0026#39;.split(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;)}\u0026#34;) List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; values) { this.values.addAll(values); } // getter setter } In the code above, we use the SpEL expression to inject a list of values into the setValues method.\n9. Using @Value with Methods When the @Value annotation is found on a method, Spring context will invoke it when all the spring configurations and beans are getting loaded. If the method has multiple arguments, then every argument value is mapped from the method annotation. If we want different values for different arguments then we can use @Value annotation directly with the argument.\n@Value(\u0026#34;Test\u0026#34;) public void printValues(String a, String b){ System.out.println(a + \u0026#34; \u0026amp; \u0026#34; + b); // Test \u0026amp; Test } @Value(\u0026#34;Test\u0026#34;) public void printOtherValues(String a, @Value(\u0026#34;Another Test\u0026#34;) String b){ System.out.println(a + \u0026#34; \u0026amp; \u0026#34; + b); // Test \u0026amp; Another Test } ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/spring-boot/spring-value-annotation/","tags":["Spring Boot Basics"],"title":"Spring @Value Annotation Guide"},{"categories":["Spring Boot"],"contents":"In this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll learn how to configure a Feign Client in your Spring Boot project to consume RESTFul APIs from other services.\nOverview Feign Client is a Declarative REST Client in Spring Boot Web Application.

Make sure:-\n You have spring-boot-starter-web and spring-cloud-starter-openfeign dependencies in your pom.xml or build.gradle You are using @SpringBootApplication and @EnableFeignClients annotations at your application starter class file ApiApplication.  Spring Boot is opinionated, when it sees the web and openfeign dependencies in the classpath, it sets up all the necessary default configuration required for Feign Client and automatically scans for the classes annotated with @FeignClient\npackage com.example.api; @SpringBootApplication @EnableFeignClients public class ApiApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(ApiApplication.class, args); } } Create Feign Client Next, we are going to create a feign client to consume from RESTFul API endpoint. Let\u0026rsquo;s create a PostFeignClient interface -\n Annotated with @FeignClient which auto scan by spring boot application to generate feign client This feign client consumes the APIs from this URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/  package com.example.api.client; @FeignClient(name = \u0026#34;postFeignClient\u0026#34;, url = \u0026#34;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\u0026#34;) public interface PostFeignClient { @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/posts\u0026#34;) List\u0026lt;Post\u0026gt; getAllPosts(); @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/posts/{postId}\u0026#34;) Post getPostById(@PathVariable Long postId); @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/posts\u0026#34;) List\u0026lt;Post\u0026gt; getPostByUserId(@RequestParam Long userId); @PostMapping(\u0026#34;/posts\u0026#34;) Post createPost(Post post); @PutMapping(\u0026#34;/posts\u0026#34;) Post updatePost(Post post); @DeleteMapping(\u0026#34;/posts/{postId}\u0026#34;) Post deletePost(@PathVariable Long postId); } Feign Client Configuration From Property file Spring boot comes with default global configurations which are applied to all the feign clients you create. Good things is you can change these global configurations from property file such as connection timeout, read timeout and logger level\napplication.yml feign: client: config: default: connectTimeout: 5000 readTimeout: 5000 loggerLevel: BASIC You can also configure each feign client individually from property file using feign client name or value. Remember, we created our feign client with name @FeignClient(name = \u0026quot;postFeignClient\u0026quot;, ...)\nFollowing properties can be configured for each feign client using name or value (e.g. postFeignClient):-\nfeign: client: config: postFeignClient: connectTimeout: 5000 readTimeout: 5000 loggerLevel: FULL errorDecoder: com.example.SimpleErrorDecoder retryer: com.example.SimpleRetryer requestInterceptors: - com.example.FooRequestInterceptor - com.example.BarRequestInterceptor decode404: false encoder: com.example.SimpleEncoder decoder: com.example.SimpleDecoder contract: com.example.SimpleContract From Configuration Class file We can also configure a feign client using a Configuration class. You have to mention this class which creating feign client using @FeignClient(configuration = \u0026quot;FeignClientConfig.class\u0026quot;, ...)\npackage com.example.api.client; import com.example.api.config.FeignClientConfig; @FeignClient(name = \u0026#34;postFeignClient\u0026#34;, configuration = FeignClientConfig.class, url = \u0026#34;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com\u0026#34;) public interface PostFeignClient {} A typical configuration class looks like this:-\npackage com.example.api.config; @Configuration public class FeignClientConfig { @Bean public RequestInterceptor requestInterceptor() { return requestTemplate -\u0026gt; { requestTemplate.header(\u0026#34;user\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;); requestTemplate.header(\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;); }; } } Feign Logging A logger is created for each Feign Client by default. Feign logging only responds to the DEBUG level.\nTo enable the feign logging for all the feign clients, declare the logging level of package name of client interfaces to DEBUG:-\nlogging: level: com.example.api.client: DEBUG To enable the feign logging for specific feign client. declare the logging level to that interface to DEBUG:-\nlogging: level: com.example.api.client.PostFeignClient: DEBUG Once you enable the feign logging by setting the logging level to DEBUG, you can further control the logging using loggerLevel configuraton property which tells Feign how much to log per request. Choices are:\n NONE, No logging (DEFAULT). BASIC, Log only the request method and URL and the response status code and execution time. HEADERS, Log the basic information along with request and response headers. FULL, Log the headers, body, and metadata for both requests and responses.  For e.g. BASIC loggerLevel for all feign clients and FULL loggerLevel for postFeignClient:-\nfeign: client: config: default: loggerLevel: BASIC postFeignClient: loggerLevel: FULL Consume and Test Feign Client Now since we have created feign client, let\u0026rsquo;s create a service layer class PostService and its implementation PostServiceImpl to consume these APIs using the feign client\npublic interface PostService { List\u0026lt;Post\u0026gt; getAllPosts(); Post getPostById(Long postId); List\u0026lt;Post\u0026gt; getAllPostsByUserId(Long userId); Post createPost(Post post); void updatePost(Long postId, Post post); void deletePost(Long postId); } @Service public class PostServiceImpl implements PostService { @Autowired private PostFeignClient postFeignClient;  @Override public List\u0026lt;Post\u0026gt; getAllPosts() { return postFeignClient.getAllPosts(); } @Override public Post getPostById(Long postId) { return postFeignClient.getPostById(postId); } @Override public List\u0026lt;Post\u0026gt; getAllPostsByUserId(Long userId) { return postFeignClient.getPostByUserId(userId); } @Override public Post createPost(Post post) { return postFeignClient.createPost(post); } @Override public void updatePost(Long postId, Post post) { postFeignClient.updatePost(post); } @Override public void deletePost(Long postId) { postFeignClient.deletePost(postId); } } Now since we have created our service class and consumed APIs using feign client. Let\u0026rsquo;s create a controller PostController to test our feign client.\n@RestController @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/posts\u0026#34;) public class PostController { @Autowired private PostService postService; @GetMapping public List\u0026lt;Post\u0026gt; getAllPosts() { return postService.getAllPosts(); } @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/{postId}\u0026#34;) public Post getPostById(@PathVariable Long postId) { return postService.getPostById(postId); } @PostMapping @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED) public Post createPost(Post post) { return postService.createPost(post); } @PutMapping(\u0026#34;/{postId}\u0026#34;) @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK) public void updatePost(@PathVariable Long postId, Post post) { postService.updatePost(postId, post); } @DeleteMapping(\u0026#34;/{postId}\u0026#34;) @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK) public void deletePost(@PathVariable Long postId) { postService.deletePost(postId); } } Let\u0026rsquo;s test our controller endpoint from the browser to see if Feign client is working.  That\u0026rsquo;s it. You have successfully created and tested feign client to consume APIs from given endpoint.\n Download the complete source code for creating feign client from github/springboot-api\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/spring-boot/configure-feign-rest-client/","tags":["Spring Boot REST"],"title":"Configure Feign Client in Spring Boot"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"This article demonstrate use of String.format() in Java with many examples\u0026hellip;\nThe String.format() method is used to produce formatted string, numeric, and date/time data, and locale specific output.

Spring Boot is opinionated, when it sees the web dependency in the classpath, it sets up all the necessary default configuration required for API development so that you can just concentrate on your business logic.\npackage com.example.api; import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; @SpringBootApplication public class ApiApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(ApiApplication.class, args); } } 3. Build RESTFul APIs We are creating a UserController class to build RESTFul APIs for CRUD operations. Few things to understand:-\n Use @RestController at class level, it helps to bind default HTTP Converters for you, e.g. when you return a User object from controller methods, it takes care of converting them in JSON. Use @RequestMapping at class level, to map APIs to URL. Use shorthand of @RequestMapping i.e. @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping at method level. Use @ResponseStatus at method level for appropriate HTTP Stats Code. Delegate the work to Service Layer, here using UserService  package com.example.api.controller; @RestController @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/users\u0026#34;) public class UserController { @Autowired private UserService userService; @GetMapping public Users getAllUsers() { return userService.getAllUsers(); } @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/{id}\u0026#34;) public User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) { return userService.getUserById(id); } @PostMapping @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED) public Long createUser(User user) { return userService.createUser(user); } @PutMapping(\u0026#34;/{id}\u0026#34;) @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK) public void updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, User user) { userService.updateUser(id, user); } @DeleteMapping(\u0026#34;/{id}\u0026#34;) @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK) public void deleteUserById(@PathVariable Long id) { userService.deleteUserById(id); } } That\u0026rsquo;s it.

Just follow with me and you will learn basics of Blockchain which you can later implement in any other language.\nBlockchain Blockchain is nothing but a digital, distributed, immutable, and trusted ledger which can be used to record anything from financial transactions, government records to land titles, or even purchase orders.\nEach transaction record is a block, which are linked together chronologically to form a chain of blocks. If you want to change record in a particular block, you don\u0026rsquo;t rewrite it. Instead, the change is recorded in a new block.\n Also read Blockchain Basics and its Practical Use Cases\n Block Let\u0026rsquo;s see what a typical block in blockchain consist of:-\n Timestamp is date and time when the transaction took place. Record typically contains the details of a transaction like sender, receiver, amount. We are going to use actual names of sender and receiver in our program but in a practical use case like bitcoin, actual names are not revealed, a digital signature of sender and receiver is used instead. Hash is a digital fingerprint that represents the transaction in the block and is completely unique. If there is any change in transaction details, the hash would also change. Generally, it\u0026rsquo;s an alphanumeric sequence generated by applying some crypto algorithm like SHA-256 on transaction details. Previous Hash is the Hash of the previous block in blockchain. This is also used to generate Hash of the block. Nonce is an abbreviation for \u0026ldquo;number only used once,\u0026rdquo; which is a number added to a block in a blockchain that, when rehashed, meets the difficulty level restrictions. We will discuss more on this later  Step 1: Create Block (block.js) Now we know the what block consist of, let\u0026rsquo;s create it\nconst SHA256 = require(\u0026#39;crypto-js/sha256\u0026#39;); class Block { constructor(timestamp, previousHash, record, difficultyLevel) { this.timestamp = timestamp; this.record = record; this.previousHash = previousHash; const proofOfWork = this.proofOfWork(difficultyLevel); this.hash = proofOfWork.hash; this.nonce = proofOfWork.nonce; } /* Genesis Block */ static genesis() { return new this(new Date(), \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;GENESIS\u0026#34; ); } /* Block Mining */ static mineBlock(previousBlock, record, difficultyLevel) { const timestamp = new Date(); const previousHash = previousBlock.hash; return new Block(timestamp, previousHash, record, difficultyLevel); } /* Generate Hash using SHA256 */ static computeHash(message){ return SHA256(message).toString(); } /* Proof of Work */ proofOfWork(difficultyLevel) { const message = this.timestamp + JSON.stringify(this.record) + this.previousHash; if(difficultyLevel){ const leadingZeros = \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;.repeat(difficultyLevel); let nonce = 0; while(true){ let hash = Block.computeHash(message + nonce); if(hash.substring(0, difficultyLevel) == leadingZeros){ return { hash, nonce }; } nonce++; } }else{ return { hash: Block.computeHash(message), nonce: 0 } } } } module.exports = Block; \nLet\u0026rsquo;s understand few more terms\n Genesis Block is the first block in blockchain which is not having any transaction details and previous hash. This is generally added at the time of creation of blockchain. Also known as Block Zero Difficulty Level is the restriction to generate hash of the block. More difficulty level, more time it takes to generate a hash. Block Mining is a process of adding a new block to the blockchain. Who adds new block is called Block Miner, also known as bitcoin miner in case of bitcoin. Anyone can register their computer to become one of the bitcoin miner in case of a public blockchain like bitcoin. All the bitcoin miners in bitcoin network get a copy of whole blockchain and each receives a notification when a new block is added to the blockchain. Proof of Work is a cryptographic hash puzzle which each Block Miner in the blockchain tries to solve. As soon as one of the Block Miner solves the puzzle, essentially means generated the hash of the block with said difficulty level, they broadcast this to the blockchain network and hash is validated by all the other Block Miners in the network.  What is Proof of Work for us? Out Proof of Work is to generate a hash with leading zeros based on difficulty level.\nDifficulty level of 5 means, generate a hash with 5 leading zeros, e.g. 00000b4d7m3h1s0k2s8bw0hn382\nHow we are going to achieve? We are going to calculate the hash by applying SHA-256 algorithm on the transaction details and nonce value. We will start with nonce value of 0 and keep incrementing it until we find the hash with leading zeros of difficulty level.\nStep 2: Create Blockchain (blockchain.js) Now we have learned a lot of terms, let\u0026rsquo;s quickly create a blockchain\nconst Block = require(\u0026#39;./block\u0026#39;); class Blockchain { constructor() { this.difficultyLevel = 1; this.chain = [Block.genesis()]; } addBlock(record) { const newBlock = Block.mineBlock(this.chain[this.chain.length-1], record, this.difficultyLevel); this.chain.push(newBlock); } } module.exports = Blockchain; Step 3: Test Blockchain (server.js) Let\u0026rsquo;s create few blocks of transaction with random sender, receiver and amount details. Also, let\u0026rsquo;s increase the difficulty level after every 2 transactions.\nconst Blockchain = require(\u0026#39;./blockchain\u0026#39;) const { performance } = require(\u0026#39;perf_hooks\u0026#39;); const blockchain = new Blockchain(); const userList = [\u0026#34;Alice\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Bob\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Charlie\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;David\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Eric\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Franklin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Gavin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Harry\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Iris\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Joey\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Kate\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Leo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Monica\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Nancy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Oscar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Phoebe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Quinn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Ross\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Sofia\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Tyler\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Umar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Victor\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Wilson\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Xena\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Yasmine\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Zara\u0026#34;]; const addNBlocks = (n) =\u0026gt; { for(let i = 0; i \u0026lt; n; i++) { blockchain.addBlock({ sender: userList[Math.floor(Math.random() * userList.length)], receiver: userList[Math.floor(Math.random() * userList.length)], amount: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) }); } } const t0 = performance.now(); addNBlocks(2); var t1 = performance.now() console.log(\u0026#34;[Difficulty Level 1] Added first 2 blocks in \u0026#34; + (t1 - t0) + \u0026#34; milliseconds.\u0026#34;) blockchain.difficultyLevel = 3; addNBlocks(2); var t2 = performance.now() console.log(\u0026#34;[Difficulty Level 3] Added next 2 blocks in \u0026#34; + (t2 - t1) + \u0026#34; milliseconds.\u0026#34;) blockchain.difficultyLevel = 5; addNBlocks(2); var t3 = performance.now() console.log(\u0026#34;[Difficulty Level 5] Added next 2 blocks in \u0026#34; + (t3 - t2) + \u0026#34; milliseconds.\u0026#34;) /* Print Blockchain*/ console.log(blockchain.chain); Now everything is ready, go to terminal and run following commands\nnpm install --save crypto-js node server You will see an output like this.\nOutput [Difficulty Level 1] Added first 2 blocks in 6.2153230011463165 milliseconds.

Blockchain technologies like bitcoin require to solve hash puzzle with the difficulty level of somewhere starting from 18 to 30. You can imagine the time requires to solve those puzzles. The first block of blockchain is GENESIS block with no transaction info and no previous hash value See the hash generated with 1, 3, and 5 leading zeros based on difficulty level See the variable nonce value keeps increasing with difficulty level, also tells us the number of attempts our hash algorithm took to generate hash.  Summary I hope you have now a basic understanding of Blockchain technology and how we can implement it. Please note that the above example is a very basic implementation of Blockchain. Real-world examples are very complicated but this is the first step to enter the Blockchain world.\n Please find the source code for this example on github\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/blockchain-explained-using-javascript/","tags":["Javascript Coding"],"title":"Blockchain Explained using JavaScript"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Most of us think Blockchain as the technology behind Bitcoin. While this was its original purpose, blockchain is capable of so much more\u0026hellip;\nWhat is Blockchain?  Blockchain is digital, distributed, immutable and trusted ledger.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s understand each term one by one:-\nBlockchain is Digital Ledger You are familiar with the ledger, which is nothing but a book to record financial transactions. Similarly, Blockchain is a digital ledger which can be programmed to record things, and the things are not limited to financial transactions, but could be anything from government records to land titles, or even purchase orders.\n General Ledger\n  Each line of record in a ledger book can be assumed as a block in blockchain, which are linked together chronologically to form a chain of blocks.\nYou write a new record in the financial ledger book for any changes in previous transactions. Similarly, If you want to change record in a particular block, you don\u0026rsquo;t rewrite it. Instead, the change is recorded in a new block.\nBlockchain is Distributed Ledger Let\u0026rsquo;s assume that I am maintaining a shared ledger book with my friends where everyone records their mutual expenses. Let\u0026rsquo;s say, I lend $100 to my friend Ben and recorded in a shared ledger. Now my friends Charlie and David know the exact amount of money I lend to Ben and they\u0026rsquo;ve essentially endorsed the transaction and they made a record of it. Now when next month, Ben asked me how much money had initially lent him, we could easily go to anyone of my friends Charlie or David that have a record of that transaction. When you make new friends, they can also join you in shared ledger.\nSimilar to a shared ledger, Anyone can opt to connect their computer to the blockchain network as node. In doing so, their computer receives a copy of the blockchain that is updated automatically whenever a new block is added, sort of like a Facebook News Feed that gives a live update whenever a new status is posted.\nIn this sense, blockchain is distributed and data is shared.\nAdvantage  Reconciliation is not required as data is shared and each node is having copy of transaction. High availability as thousands of distributed nodes working in the network, doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if few goes down.  Blockchain is Immutable Ledger Let\u0026rsquo;s look into the pieces which make up a Blockchain to understand its immutability\n  transaction: this is details of the transaction that occurred when the block was created\n  hash: this is a digital fingerprint that represents the transaction in the block and is completely unique. If there is any change in transaction details, the hash would also change. Generally, it\u0026rsquo;s an alphanumeric sequence generated by applying some crypto algorithm on transaction details\n  previousHash: this is the hash of the previous block in the chain.\n  Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the below example of blockchain. Where transaction is having sender, receiver, and amount details. For simplicity, we are generating hash by just combining transaction details, i.e.\nhash = sender + receiver + amount Please note that Block 1 is the first block in our Blockchain, also known as Genesis Block, is not having previousHash value.\nBlock 1 transaction { sender: Ash, receiver: Ben: amount: $100 } hash ashben100 previousHash Block 2 transaction { sender: Ben, receiver: Charlie: amount: $200 } hash bencharlie200 previousHash ashben100 Block 3 transaction { sender: Ash, receiver: David: amount: $300 } hash ashdavid300 previousHash bencharlie200 Let’s say a hacker attempts to edit the transaction amount in Block 2 from $200 to $999. As soon as they edit the dollar amount of the transaction, the block’s hash will change. The next block Block 3 in the chain will still contain the old previousHash, and the hacker would need to update that block in order to cover their tracks. However, doing so would change that block’s hash. And the next, and so on.\nBlock 2 (Tampered Amount) transaction { sender: Ben, receiver: Charlie: amount: $999 } hash bencharlie999 previousHash ashben100 Block 3 (Old Previous Hash) transaction { sender: Ash, receiver: David: amount: $300 } hash ashdavid300 previousHash bencharlie200 In order to change a single block, then, a hacker would need to change every single block after it on the blockchain. Recalculating all those hashes would take an enormous and improbable amount of computing power. In other words, once a block is added to the blockchain it becomes very difficult to edit and impossible to delete.\nIn this sense, Blockchains are immutable and tamper-resistant.\nBlockchain is Trusted Ledger When you transfer money to someone, you do it through a mediator, generally a bank. Now all the transaction records are centralized within the bank. There are more chances for hackers to tamper with records.\nMoreover, when you transfer a crypto currency like bitcoin, which is backed by blockchain technology, there is no mediator involved, essentially all of the nodes, millions in case of crypto currencies, in the blockchain network are mediators, having their own copy of records. If hackers want to tamper with any record, they need to do it in all those million copies of record.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s understand more on this, to become eligible for adding a new block in the blockchain, a node has to solve a very complex math problem and need to provide something called proof of work. Solving puzzle is intensive in terms of computation (time) and electricity consumption (money), which requires time as well as money.\nAs we saw earlier that hacker need to tamper with all those millions copies. If adding one block to the blockchain requires spending so much time and money, you can imagine how it will be to tamper with all those millions copies. Certainly it\u0026rsquo;s not worth the effort and more likely impossible.\nIn this sense, blockchain technology is trusted.\nBlockchain\u0026rsquo;s Use Cases 1. Bitcoin Most of the crypto currencies - Bitcoin, Dash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple follows public blockchain. Public blockchains are open to everyone to view and access, also known as permissionless blockchain as you do not require authorization.\n Crypto Currencies\n  The bitcoin protocol is built on the blockchain. Introduced as digital currency, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto referred to it as “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.”\nHow Bitcoin Works? You have all these people, all over the world, who have bitcoin. There are likely many millions of people around the world who own at least a portion of a bitcoin. Let’s say one of those millions of people wants to spend their bitcoin on groceries. This is where the blockchain comes in.\n When one person pays another for goods using bitcoin, essentially a transaction is initiated. This transactions contains all the necessary information such as sender and receiver, but not the actual names, instead a unique digital signature sort of like a username is used along with amount, timestamp, etc. Bitcoin Block transaction: { type: BITCOIN sender: g4h4g5jnsm6bd4b8d0q6d8v4zx5k2la8d9n4c6f8, receiver: m1n2h3b4b5v6c7xz89sld8ff9d47d9dft47mkd, amount: 25 timestamp: dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm:sss } hash: ??????? previousHash: b4h84nv46sn29n4b5h6j7k8l2l3nx6b3n8l38xn40z54n2bv68c  This transaction joins the other transactions that have been made on the bitcoin network.  Bitcoin Miners The bitcoin blockchain is a public blockchain which means anyone can register themselves to be one of the Bitcoin Miner. Bitcoin miners are the nodes in bitcoin blockchain network. All the nodes in the network essentially having a copy of all transactions, and anytime new transactions are made they would be notified with the new block.\n All the Bitcoin miners in the network start picking up those transactions and validate by looking through all of the transactions that happen in the Blockchain so far that those are also valid. Each Bitcoin miner try to solve the cryptographic hash puzzle, also known as proof of work algorithm. Now, this is the consensus algorithm that public and permissionless blockchains use and essentially this is how they\u0026rsquo;re able to reach a consensus on which block should be next. As soon as one of the bitcoin miner solves the puzzle, essentially means generated the hash of the next block, what they\u0026rsquo;ll do is broadcast that hash of the block to all of the other nodes in the network. All the nodes verify the authenticity of the hash and once all approve, it is added as a new block in all the nodes in the network. Bitcoin miner is also rewarded with bitcoins for their work on solving the puzzle. Solving the puzzle also referred as mining  What if one of the bitcoin miner is hacker? Bitcoin miner is one of the node in bitcoin network, if bitcoin miner is a hacker and they manipulated their own copy of record then bitcoin protocol discourage the existence of such manipulated blockchain through a process called consensus. In the presence of multiple, differing copies of the blockchain, the consensus protocol will adopt the longest chain available.\nWhy cryptographic hash puzzle is time consuming? Each node try to solve hash puzzle to generate a unique hash from transaction details using SHA-256 algorithm, this might take less time. But some protocols like bitcoin protocol restrict hash to be generated with 32 leading zeros. Generating a hash with leading or trailing zeros is more complex. Similarly Generating a hash with 10 leading zeros is more computation intensive then 5 leading zeros.\nNow you will say that transaction details are fixed, it will generate hash based on these details. How we generate a hash with leading zeros? For this block is having a special field called nonce which is also included to generate hash. Each node do trial and error with keep changing the nonce value until they found the hash with specified leading zeros.\nSHA-256 ( nonce + transaction details ) = 00000h3bdju7vb3n9s73nf92n1b38d \n2. Private Blockchain Blockchain can also be used for business like supply chain, banking and government sectors. They are mostly private blockchains, which are accessible to a select group of authorized users - such as your company, a group of banks, or government agencies. This is also known as Permissioned blockchain.\nPrivate blockchain also uses a consensus algorithm but they are not as complex as public blockchain due to the limited number of nodes.\nNodes in the permissioned blockchain are trusted, so they generally know each other. Besides, they don\u0026rsquo;t always just represent users but entire organizations. So, in this case, it\u0026rsquo;s very important that our privacy is one of the main tenants of a permissioned Blockchain.\n3. Supply Chain Let\u0026rsquo;s take an example, let\u0026rsquo;s say that there\u0026rsquo;s a retailer that purchases 25 items in $1000. Now the manufacturer receives the order from the retailer and says, \u0026ldquo;OK, let\u0026rsquo;s approve\u0026rdquo;. Let\u0026rsquo;s make sure we have enough in the warehouse and let\u0026rsquo;s work with the shipping company. So, they go to the shipping company and they say, \u0026ldquo;OK, let\u0026rsquo;s ship this 100 items\u0026rdquo; and it\u0026rsquo;s going to cost them $100 to make the shipment.\nBlock 1 transaction: { type: BUY company: Star Retailer Ltd., items: 25, total_cost: $1000, discount: $50 } hash: buystartcompanyltd25100050 previousHash: - Block 2 transaction: { type: SHIP company: Shipping Bird Co., items: 25, total_cost: $100, dispatch_date: DD MM YY, arrival_date: DD MM YY } hash: shipshippingbirdco25100ddmmyyddmmyy previousHash: buystartcompanyltd25100050 There are some privacy concerns here,\n Manufactured should know all the information about retailer and shipment Retailer should not necessarily know about the shipping cost Shipment should not necessarily know about how many retailers spent Other retailers in the blockchain should not know about this retailer and shipment  So in this case, All of the organizations are part of the Blockchain, only the retailer which is part of the transaction that took place should be able to see that information. So, privacy must be part of the Blockchain for the business being able to control who can see particular transaction details.\n4. Smart Contracts One of the most successful business applications of Blockchain technology is something called Smart Contracts. Essentially this is code that\u0026rsquo;s running on the Blockchain and whenever certain conditions are met, they are automatically executed.\nSo, in the previous example of supply chain, whenever retailer made that purchase order to the manufacturer for this amount of goods there\u0026rsquo;s probably a manufacturing agent that double-checks that order has all the necessary information in it, they then probably go to the shipping agency to make sure they can cover the shipment and if the warehouse has the correct amount of goods. They\u0026rsquo;ll then make a shipment order. Now imagine if we could automate that whole process.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s what you can do with Smart Contracts, essentially code that will make sure that all the necessary information is met, and it\u0026rsquo;ll automatically create the shipment record. If any of those conditions is not met it could automatically release a refund to the retailer. This speeds up the whole process.\nReal Estate Smart Contract can automate the process title deeds, facilitate transactions and even grant access to properties through smart keys. The technology could streamline property sale, saving buyers time and money without the need to any middleman or real estate agent.\n5. Cross Border Payments People working in other countries generally send money back home from remittance agencies which takes hours, sometime few days and also they pay a good amount as fee. Blockchain technology would eliminate those Intermediaries and cut short the transfer time as well as transfer fee.\n Blockchain innovators for Cross Border Payments\n  6. Online Voting  In many countries, voter has to be present at the polling booth to cast their vote. There were always concerns about the authenticity of manual voting and voting machines. Voting is carried out online also in many countries but they also have concerns about security and fraud. Blockchain can successfully eliminate these concerns as it will present a clear record of the votes that have been cast. The tamper-proof feature of a blockchain makes it difficult to hack a blockchain-enabled voting system. With blockchain, voters can cast their vote from the comfort of their home. Citizens residing outside country can also cast their vote. This may result in a significant rise in voter turnout.\nWest Virginia has implemented a secure mobile voting application using blockchain technology that allows voters to receive, vote, and return their ballots electronically, first kind of project in United States history in 2018.\nCompanies working on online blockchain voting solution - FollowMyVote, Voatz, Scytl, Clear Ballot, Polyas, Intelivote, SMARTMATIC, electionrunner\n7. Inter-bank Payments The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced Project Ubin, which use Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) for inter-bank payments partnered with a consortium of financial institutions like Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, DBS Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, OCBC, SGX, Standard Chartered, and UOB\n 8. Identity Management Identity of a person includes basic details (name, age, gender, nationality, address, contact, etc) and ID documents like birth certificate, driving license, voter card and unique identity card. These all details could be stored in distributed, secured, immutable blockchain records.\nBenefits  Distributed identity management system can be used by many services at the same time across the globe. Financial Services like banks can use this to verify customer identity for KYC (Know your customer) compliance. Educational Services like schools, universities can use this to provide academic certificates to student. This solves the problem of verifying the authenticity of certificates and avoid frauds of fake certificate. Government Bodies can use this to store birth certificates, marriage certificates, land titles to avoid corruption.  Summary I hope after reading this post, you have a basic understanding of blockchain technology and its practical usage. I will keep updating this post based on my findings.

Suppose you have a blog website, then schema of your web pages will be of type \u0026ldquo;Article\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;BlogPosting\u0026rdquo;. You can go through the google\u0026rsquo;s example of adding structure data using JSON-LD for \u0026ldquo;Article\u0026rdquo; type of website pages.\nSchema of structure data for all type of websites and web pages can be found in documentation of schema.org\nMicrodata and JSON-LD are two ways to add mark up in order to structure your data. Google recommends using JSON-LD as it is more cleaner approach to express the structure of the data in JSON format embedded as a \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; in the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; tag of your HTML. Its a clear separation of structure from HTML elements as compare to Microdata where you add special properties like itemprop, itemtype in HTML element tags everywhere.\nNow we know that JSON-LD is way to go. There are the steps to add structure data using JSON-LD in hugo website:\nCreate site_schema.html Partial First of all we are going to create a partial called site_schema.html which is responsible to generate structure data JSON-LD for hugo website and hugo blog pages.

It is a shorthand syntax for lambda expression that executes one method. You can write more compact and readable code using double colon operator as compare to anonymous classes and lambda expression. We are going to understand its usage with lots of examples.\n1. Overview Prerequisite You should have a basic understanding of functional interface, lambda expressions and streams to understand these examples, if not then don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you will learn those concepts as well along the way.\nDouble colon refers to a method Double colon :: is basically refers to a single method, and this single method can be a\n A Static method ClassName::staticMethodName\ne.g. Integer.parseInteger, Double.parseDouble An Instance method Object::instanceMethodName\ne.g. System.out::println, String::toUpperCase A Constructor ClassName::new A Super method super::parentMethodName\n  Double colon returns a functional interface Double colon :: always return a functional interface. There are two ways to use this returned functional interface -\n Use this to initialize a functional interface and later execute a function.\nHere we either use java built-in functional interface like Function, Supplier, Consumer, BiFunction or we create our custom functional interface using @FunctionalInterface annotation. Use this to replace lambda expression in streams.\n  Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if it\u0026rsquo;s looking too complicated. Let\u0026rsquo;s deep dive into examples to understand them better.\n2. Static Method Syntax // Lambda expression (args) -\u0026gt; ClassName.staticMethodName(args) // Method Reference ClassName::staticMethodName \n2.1 Calculator Let\u0026rsquo;s create two static methods square and multiply in Calculator class.\nclass Calculator { public static double square(double num){ return Math.pow(num, 2); } public static double multiply(double num1, double num2) { return num1*num2; } } 2.1.1 Initialize Functional Interface Let’s initialize java built-in Function, BiFunction functional interface and apply it to find square and multiply respectively.\nFunction interface accepts one argument and returns one argument. Here, it takes one Double arg and return its square.\nBiFunction interface accepts two arguments and returns one argument. Here, it takes two Double args and return its multiplication.\n// Initialize functional interface Function\u0026lt;Double, Double\u0026gt; square = Calculator::square; BiFunction\u0026lt;Double, Double, Double\u0026gt; multiply = Calculator::multiply; // Execute function square.apply(3.0); multiply.apply(2.5, 5.0) Output 9.0 12.5 2.1.2 Replace Lambda Expression We generate square of list of Integer by replacing lambda expression with method reference.\nList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3); // Lambda expression numbers.stream().map(number -\u0026gt; Calculator.square(number)).forEach(number -\u0026gt; System.out.println(number)); // Method Reference numbers.stream().map(Calculator::square).forEach(System.out::println); Output 1.0 4.0 9.0 \n2.2 Integer::parseInt We know that parseInt is a static method in Integer class.\n2.2.1 Initialize Functional Interface Let\u0026rsquo;s initialize java built-in Function functional interface and apply it to parse String to Integer.\nFunction interface takes one argument and returns one argument. Here in example, it takes a String argument and returns Integer.\n// Initialize functional interface Function\u0026lt;String, Integer\u0026gt; parseInt = Integer::parseInt; // Execute function parseInt.apply(\u0026#34;2019\u0026#34;); Output 2019 2.2.2 Replace Lambda Expression Let\u0026rsquo;s parse a list of String to Integer using its static parseInt method. We see that how we can replace lambda expression with method reference resulting in same output.\nList\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; years = Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;2019\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2020\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2021\u0026#34;); // Lambda Expression years.stream().map(year -\u0026gt; Integer.parseInt(year)).forEach(year -\u0026gt; System.out.println(year)); // Method Reference years.stream().map(Integer::parseInt).forEach(System.out::println); Output 2019 2020 2021 \n3. Instance Method Syntax // Lambda expression (args) -\u0026gt; object.instanceMethodName(args) // Method Reference object::instanceMethodName \n3.1 Calculator Let\u0026rsquo;s create two instance methods square and multiply in Calculator class.\nclass Calculator { public double square(double num){ return Math.pow(num, 2); } public double multiply(double num1, double num2) { return num1*num2; } } 3.1.1 Initialize Functional Interface Let’s initialize java built-in Function, BiFunction functional interface and apply it to find square and multiply respectively.\n// Initialize functional interface Function\u0026lt;Double, Double\u0026gt; square = new Calculator()::square; BiFunction\u0026lt;Double, Double, Double\u0026gt; multiply = new Calculator()::multiply; // Execute function square.apply(3.0); multiply.apply(2.5, 5.0) Output 9.0 12.5 3.1.2 Replace Lambda Expression We generate square of list of Integer by replacing lambda expression with method reference.\nList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3); // Lambda expression numbers.stream().map(number -\u0026gt; new Calculator().square(number)).forEach(number -\u0026gt; System.out.println(number)); // Method Reference numbers.stream().map(new Calculator()::square).forEach(System.out::println); Output 1.0 4.0 9.0 \n3.2 System.out::println 3.2.1 Initialize Functional Interface Let\u0026rsquo;s initialize java built-in Supplier functional interface to print a String.\nSupplier interface accepts one argument and returns nothing. Here in example, it accepts a String argument and print it.\n// Initialize functional interface Consumer\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; println = System.out::println; // Execute function println.accept(\u0026#34;Learning Method Reference a.k.a Colon Operator ::\u0026#34;); Output Learning Method Reference a.k.a Colon Operator :: 3.2.2 Replace Anonymous Class and Lambda Expression We will print a list of String and see how double colon :: method reference makes the code more concise and readable as compare to anonymous class and lambda expression.\nList\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; languages = Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;java\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;javascript\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;css\u0026#34;); // Anonymous Class languages.forEach(new Consumer\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;() { @Override public void accept(String str) { System.out.println(str); } }); // Lambda expression languages.forEach(str -\u0026gt; System.out.println(str)); // Method Reference languages.forEach(System.out::println); Output java javascript css 3.2.3 Print a list of Integer Let\u0026rsquo;s print a list of integer using lambda expression and double colon :: method reference.\nList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; numbers = Arrays.asList(1,2,3); // Lambda expression numbers.forEach(number-\u0026gt;System.out.println(number)); // Method Reference numbers.forEach(System.out::println); Output 1 2 3 \n3.3 String::toUpperCase 3.3.1 Initialize Functional Interface Let\u0026rsquo;s initialize java built-in Function functional interface and execute it to change String to UPPERCASE.\n// Initialize functional interface Function\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; toUpperCase = String::toUpperCase; // Execute function toUpperCase.apply(\u0026#34;java\u0026#34;); Output JAVA 3.3.2 Replace Lambda Expression Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the example where we use multiple method references to print the String in uppercase.\nList\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; languages = Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;java\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;javascript\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;css\u0026#34;); // Lambda expression languages.stream().map(str -\u0026gt; str.toUpperCase()).forEach(str -\u0026gt; System.out.println(str)); // Method Reference languages.stream().map(String::toUpperCase).forEach(System.out::println); Output JAVA JAVASCRIPT CSS \n4. Constructor Double colon :: operator can be used to create an instance by calling constructor.\nSyntax ClassName::new \n4.1 Create an int[10] array // Default int[] array1 = new int[10]; // Method Reference IntFunction\u0026lt;int[]\u0026gt; arrayMaker = int[]::new; int[] array2 = arrayMaker.apply(10); \n4.2 Create HashMap // Default Map map1 = new HashMap(); // Method Reference Supplier\u0026lt;Map\u0026gt; mapMaker = HashMap::new; Map map2 = mapMaker.get(); \n5. Super Method Syntax super::parentMethodName We create square and multiply instance methods in Calculator class and then call those methods in our inherited AdvanceCalculator class using super::parentMethodName to create advance methods squareAndAdd and squareAndMultiply\nclass Calculator { public double square(double num){ return Math.pow(num, 2); } public double multiply(double num1, double num2) { return num1*num2; } } class AdvanceCalculator extends Calculator { public double squareAndAdd(double num1, double num2) { Function\u0026lt;Double, Double\u0026gt; square = super::square; return square.apply(num1) + square.apply(num2); } public double squareAndMultiply(double num1, double num2) { Function\u0026lt;Double, Double\u0026gt; square = super::square; BiFunction\u0026lt;Double, Double, Double\u0026gt; multiply = super::multiply; return multiply.apply(square.apply(num1), square.apply(num2)); } } \n6. Real World Practical example Let\u0026rsquo;s create a Class Tutorial with properties name, duration and rating.\nclass Tutorial { private String name; private Integer duration; private Double rating; public Tutorial(String name) { this.name = name; this.duration = 0; this.rating = 0.0; } public Tutorial(String name, Integer duration) { this.name = name; this.duration = duration; this.rating = 0.0; } public Tutorial(String name, Integer duration, Double rating) { this.name = name; this.duration = duration; this.rating = rating; } public String getName() { return name; }\tpublic void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } public Integer getDuration() { return duration; } public void setDuration(Integer duration) { this.duration = duration; } public Double getRating() { return rating; } public void setRating(Double rating) { this.rating = rating; } @Override public String toString() { return \u0026#34;Tutorial[ \u0026#34; + name + \u0026#34;\\t- \u0026#34; + duration + \u0026#34;min, rating=\u0026#34; + rating + \u0026#34; ]\u0026#34;; } public static int compareByRating(Tutorial t1, Tutorial t2) { return t1.getRating().compareTo(t2.getRating()); } public static int compareByDuration(Tutorial t1, Tutorial t2) { return t1.getDuration().compareTo(t2.getDuration()); } } Let\u0026rsquo;s create a list of tutorials objects:-\n// List of tutorials List\u0026lt;Tutorial\u0026gt; tutorials = Arrays.asList(new Tutorial[] { new Tutorial(\u0026#34;Streams in Java 8\u0026#34;, 30, 4.2), new Tutorial(\u0026#34;What\u0026#39;s new in Java 11\u0026#34;, 25, 4.8), new Tutorial(\u0026#34;Core Java Concepts\u0026#34;, 45, 3.5)}); \n6.1 Print the list of tutorials // Lambda Expression tutorials.forEach(tutorial -\u0026gt; System.out.println(tutorial)); // Method Reference tutorials.forEach(System.out::println); Output Tutorial[ Streams in Java 8\t- 30min, rating=4.2 ] Tutorial[ What's new in Java 11\t- 25min, rating=4.8 ] Tutorial[ Core Java Concepts\t- 45min, rating=3.5 ] \n6.2 Get list of tutorial names in uppercase // Lambda Expression tutorials.stream().map(tutorial -\u0026gt; tutorial.getName()).map(name -\u0026gt; name.toUpperCase()).forEach(s -\u0026gt; System.out.println(s)); // Method Reference tutorials.stream().map(Tutorial::getName).map(String::toUpperCase).forEach(System.out::println); Output STREAMS IN JAVA 8 WHAT'S NEW IN JAVA 11 CORE JAVA CONCEPTS \n6.3 Sort Tutorials by Rating // Lambda Expression tutorials.stream().sorted((tutorial1, tutorial2) -\u0026gt; Tutorial.compareByRating(tutorial1, tutorial2)).forEach(tutorial -\u0026gt; System.out.println(tutorial)); // Method Reference tutorials.stream().sorted(Tutorial::compareByRating).forEach(System.out::println);\tOutput Tutorial[ Core Java Concepts\t- 45min, rating=3.5 ] Tutorial[ Streams in Java 8\t- 30min, rating=4.2 ] Tutorial[ What's new in Java 11\t- 25min, rating=4.8 ] \n6.4 Sort Tutorials by Duration // Lambda Expression tutorials.stream().sorted((tutorial1, tutorial2) -\u0026gt; Tutorial.compareByDuration(tutorial1, tutorial2)).forEach(tutorial -\u0026gt; System.out.println(tutorial)); // Method Reference tutorials.stream().sorted(Tutorial::compareByDuration).forEach(System.out::println);\tOutput Tutorial[ What's new in Java 11\t- 25min, rating=4.8 ] Tutorial[ Streams in Java 8\t- 30min, rating=4.2 ] Tutorial[ Core Java Concepts\t- 45min, rating=3.5 ] \n6.5 Create New Instance of Tutorial Each constructor method reference returns a Functional Interface.

It is very useful to keep your code concise and readable specially in streams where you can replace lambda expressions with method reference using double colon operator.\nModern IDEs such as Eclipse (Quick Fix Feature) and IntelliJ IDEA (Intention Feature) provide built in support to convert lambda expression to an equivalent method reference.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/java/double-colon-operator-in-java-8/","tags":["Java Streams"],"title":"Double Colon (::) Operator in Java 8"},{"categories":["Spring Boot"],"contents":"Spring boot use tomcat as default embedded tomcat server to run a web application but you can configure jetty server to replace tomcat in easy steps.\nAdd spring-boot-starter-jetty dependency We need to do two things here:-\n Exclude default dependency spring-boot-starter-tomcat added in spring-boot-start-web Add spring-boot-starter-jetty dependency.  \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-web\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;exclusions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;exclusion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-tomcat\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/exclusion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/exclusions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-jetty\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; That\u0026rsquo;s it.

It becomes essential to log incoming API request and response and push it to centralized logging system such as Splunk or ELK for debugging. Also all the logs related to one request should have some common id to relate them. In this post we are going to solve these problems.\n1. Create RESTFul API Let\u0026rsquo;s create a RestController to expose RESTFul API\n@RestController @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/posts\u0026#34;) public class PostController { @GetMapping public List\u0026lt;Post\u0026gt; getAllPosts() { return Arrays.asList(new Post[] { new Post[] { new Post(\u0026#34;spring\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Spring Boot\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;All about Spring boot microservice\u0026#34;), new Post(\u0026#34;java\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Java\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Learn Streams in Java\u0026#34;), new Post(\u0026#34;javascript\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;JavaScript\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Whats new in ES6\u0026#34;)\t}); } }  \n2. Create API Logger At this point we have exposed API but we haven\u0026rsquo;t logged it yet. Let\u0026rsquo;s create an API logger which is having following configurable properties:-\n app.api.logging.enable If true then api logger will be enabled and log all api request and response app.api.logging.url-patterns If provided in a comma separated url patterns, only those api request and response will be logged. default value is '*' means all api request and response will be printed app.api.logging.requestIdParamName If provided request parameter in incoming api request will be logged across all logs to serve that request. default value is requestId. If not provided, new request id (uuid) will be generated to log across all logs.  import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.condition.ConditionalOnExpression; import org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.FilterRegistrationBean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.stereotype.Component; @Component @ConditionalOnExpression(\u0026#34;${app.api.logging.enable:true}\u0026#34;) public class ApiLoggingFilterConfig { @Value(\u0026#34;${app.api.logging.url-patterns:*}\u0026#34;) \tprivate String[] urlPatterns; @Value(\u0026#34;${app.api.logging.requestIdParamName:requestId}\u0026#34;) \tprivate String requestIdParamName; @Bean public FilterRegistrationBean\u0026lt;ApiLoggingFilter\u0026gt; loggingFilter() { FilterRegistrationBean\u0026lt;ApiLoggingFilter\u0026gt; registrationBean = new FilterRegistrationBean\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); registrationBean.setFilter(new ApiLoggingFilter(requestIdParamName)); registrationBean.addUrlPatterns(urlPatterns); return registrationBean; } } Now we will create ApiLoggingFilter which is nothing but a Servlet Filter.

Summary We saw in this post that how we can create custom logger to print API request and response. Also incoming request can have requestId parameter which can be printed across all the logs which serves that request. This parameter can be further passed down in downstream microservices to further print it in the logs. This way a request can be tracked end to end from the logs.\nPlease find the complete source code of custom logging API on github springboot-microservice\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/spring-boot/custom-api-request-response-logging/","tags":["Spring Boot REST"],"title":"Custom API Request \u0026 Response Logging in spring boot."},{"categories":["Spring Boot"],"contents":"In spring boot microservices based application, where microservices talks to each other using RESTFul APIs.

These questions verifies your theoretical as well as practical knowledge about microservices. Keep following this post for regular updates.\nQ1. What do you understand by microservices? When you break an entire application architecture into smaller services where\n Each service is independently serves a functionality of that application Each service has their own development, build process, deployment and testing cycle  This kind of setup is known as microservices based architecture.\nQ2. What are the advantage of microservices over monolithic application?    Monolithic application Microservices based application     Single code base for entire application so one small code change requires the build process, testing and deployment of entire application. Each microservice can be developed, build, deployed and tested independently and code change in one microservice doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect entire application.   Single code base for entire application so can be written in one technology. Each Microservice can be written in different technology stack like Java, Scala, Python, NodeJs etc.   Monolithic application can be scaled vertically by adding more servers. It can be scaled both vertically and horizontally by adding more servers and running multiple copies of each microservice behind a load balancer.   If something goes wrong with monolithic application and its down means whole application is down. It is fault tolerant and continue to run with limited functionality if something goes wrong in few microservices and they are down.    \nQ3. You have to migrate an existing monolithic application to microservices. What will be your approach? Migrating from monolithic application to microservices is a long term process where we gradually :-\n Pick one functionality of monolithic application Copy the functionality from monolithic application in terms of source code, database, schema Create an independent microservice which serves the same functionality Integrate monolithic application with this microservice Remove the source code, database, schema etc from monolithic application when integration with microservice is successful.  Repeat the above 5 steps until our entire monolithic application is converted into microservices.\nQ4. What are the best practices to design microservices based application ? These are few best practices to design microservice:-\n One functionality one microservice Separate data source for each microservice Follow twelve factors from The Twelve-Factor App  \nQ5. What are the challenges in microservices based application ? The challenges with microservices are as follows:-\n Require good investment for infrastructure setup. It is a nightmare to manage development, build, test, deployment and release cycles manually. DevOps is must to implement CI/CD (Continuous integration, continuous delivery) automation. Difficult to troubleshoot or debug an issue spanning across multiple microservices. Overhead of inter communication between microservices Challenges in development and testing where two or more microservices are involved. Difficult to make configuration change across large fleet of microservices. Operation and maintenance overhead. Challenges comes with distributes system such as Network latency, fault tolerance, distributed transactions, unreliable networks, handling asynchronous operations.  \nQ6. How do you troubleshoot an issue using logs in microservices based application ? For troubleshooting an issue using logs in microservices based application,\n We should have a centralized logging system where each microservice push their logs to Splunk or ELK (Elastic Logstash Kibana) and we can use their built in dashboards to look at the logs for debugging. We can generate a requestId for each external request, which is passed to all the microservices which are involved in handling the request. Include this requestId in all log messages pushed to splunk or ELK. We can troubleshoot any request end to end using this requestId if something goes wrong.   Also read how to create custom logger to print API request and response along with incoming requestId\n \nQ7. How do you manage configuration in microservices based application ? If we want to modify the configuration for a microservice that has been replicated a hundred times (one hundred processes are running). If the configuration for this microservice is packaged with the microservice itself, we’ll have to redeploy each of the one hundred instances. This can result in some instances using the old configuration, and some using the new one, at some point. Moreover, sometimes microservices use external connections which, for example, require URLs, usernames, and passwords. If you want to update these settings, it would be useful to have this configuration shared across services.\nWe use externalize configuration to solve this problem by keeping the configuration information in an external store such as github, database, filesystem, or environment variables or even a configuration server. At startup, microservices load the configuration from the external store or configuration server.\nNetflix Archaius and Spring Cloud Config Server provides ready made solution for externalize configuration.\n\nQ8. How do microservices communicate with each other ? Microservices often communicate with each other using RESTful APIs over HTTP. The communication can be broadly divided into two categories:-\n RestTemplate, WebClient, FeignClient can be used for synchronous communication between microservices ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Kafka can be used for asynchronous communication across microservices.  \nQ9. How do you manage authentication and authorization in microservices based application ? Session based authentication works well with stateful monolith applications but token based authentication and authorization is recommended for microservices based application to maintain the statelessness. A typical flow of token based authentication is as follows:-\n User sends a login request with username and password. If you are using Api gateway then it is responsible for generating the token and hence authentication. It achieves this by communicating with authorization and users service. User receives a token on successful login which is typically stored in browser cookies. Token holds the user\u0026rsquo;s information in the encrypted format. When user make any request of resources, this token is sent in Authorization header of each request. Microservices decrypts the token and evaluate user information to authorize for resource access and send the response accordingly.  JWT JWT (Json Web Token) is widely used token based authentication mechanism. JWT consist of three parts:\n header contains type, fixed value JWT and the hashing algorithm used by JWT { \u0026quot;typ\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;JWT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;alg\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;HS256\u0026quot; }  payload typically contains user authorization related information such as id, name, roles, permissions etc. It also contains the expiry period of token. { \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: 12345, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;admin_user\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;email\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;admin_user@organization.com\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;roles\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;admin\u0026quot;], \u0026quot;permissions\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;can_access_resource_1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;can_access_resource_2\u0026quot;] }  signature is required to verify the authenticity of token. It consists of the encoded header, the payload and the secret key. HMACSHA256( base64UrlEncode(header) + \u0026quot;.\u0026quot; + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret )   All microservices can verify the token based on the signature so there are no further calls to the authorization server after login.\nAuthentication \u0026amp; Authorization flow using JWT  User Authentication \u0026amp; Authorization flow using JWT\n  \nQ10. How do you handle distributed transaction across microservices ? Transactions are easy to handle in monolithic application with single code base, single data source and deployment on single server whereas it becomes a challenge to handle a distributed transaction across microservices where each microservice has its own data store and deployed on different servers. There are different approach to handle distributed transactions:\n1. Avoid if at all possible First and foremost approach is to avoid them completely.\nIf we can not avoid transaction between two microservices. Just think,\nAre they meant to be together? Merge them in one microservice?\nCan we redesign them in such a way so that transaction becomes unnecessary.\n2. Two-phase commit protocol (2PC) Two phase commit protocol commits into 2 steps:\n Prepare Phase The transaction coordinator send a prepare command to each participant in the transaction Each participant then checks if they could commit the transaction. Commit Phase If that’s the case, they respond with “prepared” and the transaction coordinator sends a commit command to all participants. The transaction was successful, and all changes get committed.\nor Rollback Phase If any of the participant doesn’t answer the prepare command or responds with “failed”, the transaction coordinator sends an abort command to all participants. This rolls back all the changes performed within the transaction.  Its an old, complicated and slow approach because of all the coordination things and should be avoided.\n3. The Saga pattern Saga is one of the well known pattern for distributed transactions.\nA saga is a sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates data within a single service. The first transaction is initiated by an external request corresponding to the system operation, and then each subsequent step is triggered by the completion of the previous one.\nThere are a two ways to implement a saga transaction:-\nEvents/Choreography In this approach there is no central coordination, executes a transaction and then publishes an event. This event is listened by one or more services which execute local transactions and publish (or not) new events.\nThe distributed transaction ends when the last service executes its local transaction and does not publish any events or the event published is not heard by any of the saga’s participants.\nLet’s see how it would look like in our e-commerce example:\n Event Saga Pattern (Success Use Case)\n  \n Order Service saves a new order, set the state as pending and publish an event called ORDER_CREATED_EVENT. The Payment Service listens to ORDER_CREATED_EVENT, charge the client and publish the event BILLED_ORDER_EVENT. The Stock Service listens to BILLED_ORDER_EVENT, update the stock, prepare the products bought in the order and publish ORDER_PREPARED_EVENT. Delivery Service listens to ORDER_PREPARED_EVENT and then pick up and deliver the product. At the end, it publishes an ORDER_DELIVERED_EVENT Finally, Order Service listens to ORDER_DELIVERED_EVENT and set the state of the order as concluded.  In the case above, if the state of the order needs to be tracked, Order Service could simply listen to all events and update its state.\nRollback For Rollback, you have to implement another operation/transaction to compensate for what has been done before.\nSuppose that Stock Service has failed during a transaction. Let’s see what the rollback would look like:\n Event Saga Pattern (Failure Use Case)\n  \n Stock Service produces PRODUCT_OUT_OF_STOCK_EVENT; Both Order Service and Payment Service listen to the previous message:  Payment Service refund the client Order Service set the order state as failed    Note that it is crucial to define a common shared ID for each transaction, so whenever you throw an event, all listeners can know right away which transaction it refers to.\nIt is simple, easy to understand, does not require much effort to build.\nCommand/Orchestration when a coordinator service is responsible for centralizing the saga’s decision making and sequencing business logic.\n Please read this post for for more details on Command/Orchestration pattern\n \nQ11. What is service discovery pattern in microservices ? Service discovery is a pattern in microservices which solves the problem of service registry and discovery.\nService Discovery registers entries of all of the services running under that application. Whenever a service is up and running, it registers itself with discovery server and thereafter discovery server polls those services to check their heartbeats if they are up or down.\nWhen one service (client) wants to make a request to another service, it can talk to discovery server to locate the service in two ways:-\n1. Client side service discovery Client asks the address of service from discovery server and then once client gets the address, it requests to the service directly.\nClient ask service_address ⟹ Discovery Server give service_address ⟹ Client make request ⟹ Service return response ⟹ Client\nNetflix Eureka is one of the implementation of client side service discovery pattern. 2. Server side service discovery Client request to discovery server which redirect the request to appropriate service and get the response back and redirect to client.\nClient make request ⟹ Discovery Server redirect request ⟹ Service return response ⟹ Discovery Server redirect response ⟹ Client\n\nQ12. What is circuit breaker pattern in microservices ? Circuit breaker is popular pattern for fault tolerance in microservices.\nProblem Services sometimes call other services to handle requests. There is always a possibility that the other service is unavailable or taking longer time to respond. Precious resources such as threads might be consumed in the caller service while waiting for the other service to respond. This might lead to resource exhaustion, which would make the calling service unable to handle other requests. The failure of one service can potentially cascade to other services throughout the application.\nSolution Thats where circuit breaker comes into play to prevent service failure from cascading to other services.\n Circuit Breaker\n  Consider one service calling another service like an electric circuit breaker. When all works fine circuit breaker is closed.\n  When service detects that something is wrong with another service, the circuit breaks (circuit breaker is open).\n✦ When to break circuit?\n✓ When m out of last n requests failed (When 3 out of last 5 requests failed)\n✓ Request is considered failed if it responds after timeout period of t seconds (say 2s)\n  Once circuit breaks, service do not attempt to call another service.\n✦ What to do when circuit breaks?\n● throw an error or\n● return a fallback \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; response or\n● save previous responses from cache\n  After waiting for sleep window of x seconds (say 10s), service attempts to call another service (circuit breaker is half open)\n● If request fails then circuit breaks (circuit breaker is open). It repeats step 2 and 3 again.\n● If gets a successful response back then circuit gets closed. Resume the requests again. All works fine.\n  Netflix Hystrix is one of the implementation of circuit breaker pattern.\n\nQ13. What is API gateway pattern in microservices ? API gateway pattern is a good approach to consider when building large or complex microservices based application.\nAPI Gateway Flow  API Gateway\n  API Gateway Features API gateway provides a single entry point to access microservices and facilitate following features:-\n  Reverse proxy or gateway routing The API Gateway offers a reverse proxy to redirect or route HTTP requests to the endpoints of the internal microservices. The gateway provides a single endpoint or URL for the client apps and then internally maps the requests to a group of internal microservices. This routing feature helps to decouple the client apps from the microservices.\n  Request aggregation As part of the gateway pattern you can aggregate multiple client HTTP requests targeting multiple internal microservices into a single client request. This pattern is especially convenient when a client page/screen needs information from several microservices. With this approach, the client app sends a single request to the API Gateway that dispatches several requests to the internal microservices and then aggregates the results and sends everything back to the client app. The main benefit and goal of this design pattern is to reduce chattiness and round-trips between the client apps and the backend API.\n  Cross-cutting concerns or gateway offloading. Depending on the features offered by each API Gateway product, you can offload functionality from individual microservices to the gateway, which simplifies the implementation of each microservice by consolidating cross-cutting concerns into one tier. This is especially convenient for specialized features that can be complex to implement properly in every internal microservice, such as the following functionality:\n Authentication \u0026amp; Authorization Authentication and Authorization is done at API gateway level and services do not need do further check.\nAPI gateway authenticates incoming request by evaluating OAuth token given by OAuth authentication server on successful authentication. This OAuth token can be used in subsequent requests. After successful authentication API gateway authorize the request using access token (eg, send in custom HTTP header). Based on authorization, gateway route the request to services. Logging, debugging API gateway logs each incoming requests and outgoing response to centralized logging system where other microservices also push their logs. API gateway generates a request_id for each incoming request which is passed through all the microservices serving that request. Any request can be traced end to end using this request_id. Response Caching\nAPI gateway can use caching mechanism for some of the request to provide response without routing request to underlying microservices. Load balancing\nAPI gateway can load balance incoming request if multiple instances of same microservice is running. Retry policies, circuit breaker API gateway can provide a fault tolerant system by implementing retry policies and circuit breaker. IP whitelisting\nAdvantage of API gateway is that you need to provide only one IP for whitelisting when distributing APIs to thirdparty if required. Encryption\nAPI gateway can provide encrypted communication to clients while underlying microservices communication remain unencrypted. API gateway decrypts the incoming request, route to microservices, encrypt the response and send to clients. SSL Certificate management\nAPI gateway communication can be secured by providing SSL certificate to clients since API gateway is exposed whereas underlying microservices can communicate without SSL certification under a secure network.    API Gateway - Cross Cutting Concerns  API Gateway - Cross Cutting Concerns\n  Netflix Zuul is one of the implementation of API Gateway pattern.\nBackend for Frontend (BFF) When you have multiple API gateways and each API gateway provide different API tailored for different clients app then this pattern is called Backend for Frontend (BFF) pattern.\n Multiple API Gateways - Backend for Frontend (BFF)\n   \nQ14. Could you explain a high level microservice architecture ?  Microservice High Level Architecture\n  The diagram say it all, Let\u0026rsquo;s see them one by one:\n Client — Client can be a Mobile App, Dynamic Single Page Web Application using Angular, ReactJS, Vue, WebComponents or any traditional clients which renders HTML. CDN (Content Delivery Network) — CDN is a system of distributed servers or networks of servers in locations all over the world. It delivers content from the website or mobile application to people more quickly and efficiently, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage, and the content delivery server. Load Balancer (Hardware/Software) — If there is a high value of incoming traffic and it is affecting system performance and ultimately user experience, application traffic needs to be distributed evenly and efficiently at multiple servers in a server farm. The load balancer sits between client devices and backend servers, receiving and then distributing incoming requests to any available server based on the load balancing algorithm such as Round Robin, Weighted Round Robin, Random, Least Connection, Weighted Least Connection, etc. Web Apps — Clients like Mobile App or SPA can talk to API gateway directly whereas traditional clients can talk to API gateway through load balanced web apps which are hosted on any web server like Apache, Tomcat, Heroku, etc. API Gateway (Zuul) — It’s a server that provides single entry point to talk with microservices. It offers reverse proxy for request routing and request aggregation. It is also responsible for cross cutting concerns such as Authentication \u0026amp; Authorization, logging, Response caching, Encryption, SSL certificate management, rate limiting, spike arrest. Any request coming from clients first go through the API Gateway after that it routes requests to the appropriate microservice. Netflix Zuul provides implementation of API Gateway. Service Discovery (Eureka) — Service Discovery holds the information like IP address, running port about all the microservices under applications. Microservice registers themselves with discovery server when up and running. Netflix Eureka provides implementation of Service Discovery. Management — Management Endpoints (Actuator endpoints) allow you to monitor and interact with your application. Spring Boot actuator includes several built-in endpoints and you can also add your own. Like, the health endpoint provides basic application health information. It’s widely used by containers to check the health and other parameters of the application. Microservices — These microservices are designed around business capabilities, can be deployed independently and loosely coupled. Communication among themselves happens through rest call. Event Bus (Kafka, RabbitMQ) — Event buses are used in microservices based application to avoid messy communication network and keep the communication across microservices clean, loosely coupled, non blocking, asynchronous. Event buses are nothing but a publish/subscribe system like Kafka, RabbitMQ which are used for async tasks like notifications, alerts, background jobs etc to improve performance significantly. Logging and Monitoring (ELK, Splunk) — Microservices based applications requires a centralized logging and monitoring system. One client request could be served by many services all together. In case of any failure, we need to track the request flow end to end across microservice, and this is where logging and monitoring tools helps like ELK (Elastic Search, Logstash and Kibana), Splunk, Grafana.  \nQ15. What is 12 Factor App ? The Twelve-Factor App is a mythology for writing microservices. Following is an easy to understand summary of those 12 factors:-\n1. Codebase One codebase, multiple deploys.\nWe should have only one repository for each microservice in our source control such as git, subversion. All the microservice deployment should be from that repository.\n2. Dependencies Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.\nWe should use dependency manager in our microservice such as maven (pom.xml) or gradle (build.gradle) for Java. Benefit is new developer can check out code onto their machine, requiring only language runtime and dependency manager as prerequisite.\n3. Config Store config in the environment.\nWe should create a Spring Cloud Config Server to manage configurations of all microservices across all environments like dev, staging, prod.\nWe should not declare configuration inside source code because configuration varies across deployments but code does not.\n4. Backing services Treat backing services as attached resources.\nWe should integrate microservice with resources like datastores, messaging systems, caching system or other microservices from the configuration only. All the resource URL, locator, credentials should come from configuration no matter if it is a thirdparty resource or developed by your organization.\n5. Build, Release \u0026amp; Run Strictly separate build and run stages.\nWe should use release management tools like Jenkins to create pipelines to separate the build (building executable by compiling source code), release (executable with configuration) and run (deployment of release to specific environment) stages.\nRelease should have a unique id such as timestamp or version like v1.0.0 which can not be mutated. Any change must be a new release.\n6. Processes Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.\nMicroservice we build, should be stateless and should not rely on in-memory cache or filesystem to store data since it usually wiped out on restart. Any data that need to be persist must be stored in backing service like database. However distributed cache like memcache, ehcache or Redis can be used.\nWe should also never use and rely on \u0026ldquo;sticky sessions\u0026rdquo;.\n7. Port Binding Export services via port binding.\nWe should always create a standalone microservice using spring boot which is having embedded Tomcat or Jetty webserver. As soon as service starts, it is ready to serve over HTTP by binding to a port. We should not rely on creating a war and then deploying to webserver.\n8. Concurrency Scale out via the process model.\nEach microservice in application should be able to handle more load by scaling out (deploying multiple copies on microservice behind load balancer).\n9. Disposability Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown\nWe should try to minimize the startup time of microservice and handle the shutdown gracefully. Microservice should be able to start and stop at moment\u0026rsquo;s notice to facilitate fast elastic scaling, rapid deployment of code or config changes.\n10. Dev/Prod parity Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.\nWe should adapt CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuos Delivery) by combining DevOps automation tools like Jenkins to build pipelines, Docker to containerize build with all dependencies, Chef and Puppet to automate delivery process. CI/CD process minimize the gap between development, testing, staging and production environments.\n11. Logs Treat logs as event streams\nMicroservice should not manage log files itself, instead treat it as event stream and route it to a centralized log indexing and analysis system such as Splunk or ELK (Elastic logstash Kibana) or data warehousing system such as Hadoop/Hive.\n12. Admin processes Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes\nAll admin/management tasks for a microservice like database migration should be deployed and run separately.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/top-microservices-interview-questions/","tags":["Interview Q\u0026A","Microservice Q\u0026A"],"title":"Top Microservices Interview Questions"},{"categories":["Spring Boot"],"contents":"When you create a Spring @RestController in a Spring Boot application to define API endpoints then it renders JSON response by default if jackson2 is in classpath.\nJSON responses are not pretty print by default but you can enable it with just one property change.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create a @RestController class.\n@RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/posts\u0026#34;) public class PostController { @GetMapping public List\u0026lt;Post\u0026gt; getAllPosts() { return Arrays.asList(new Post[] { new Post(1, \u0026#34;post title 1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;post body 1\u0026#34;), new Post(2, \u0026#34;post title 2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;post body 2\u0026#34;), new Post(3, \u0026#34;post title 3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;post body 3\u0026#34;)\t}); } } Look at default JSON Response,\nWe see that by default JSON response is not pretty print.

We will use this instance in our producer service class.\npackage com.abc.demo.config; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import org.apache.kafka.common.config.SslConfigs; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.kafka.core.DefaultKafkaProducerFactory; import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate; import org.springframework.kafka.core.ProducerFactory; @Configuration public class KafkaProducerConfig { @Autowired private ProducerFactory\u0026lt;Integer, String\u0026gt; producerFactory; public Map\u0026lt;String, Object\u0026gt; producerConfig(){ Map\u0026lt;String, Object\u0026gt; kafkaAutoConfig = ((DefaultKafkaProducerFactory\u0026lt;Integer, String\u0026gt;) producerFactory).getConfigurationProperties(); Map\u0026lt;String, Object\u0026gt; producerConfig = new HashMap\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); producerConfig.putAll(kafkaAutoConfig); producerConfig.compute(SslConfigs.SSL_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD_CONFIG, (k,v) -\u0026gt; (String)v); producerConfig.compute(SslConfigs.SSL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_CONFIG, (k,v) -\u0026gt; (String)v); producerConfig.compute(SslConfigs.SSL_KEY_PASSWORD_CONFIG, (k,v) -\u0026gt; (String)v); return producerConfig; } @Bean public KafkaTemplate\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; kafkaTemplate(){ return new KafkaTemplate\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(new DefaultKafkaProducerFactory\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(producerConfig())); } } \nCreate KafkaProducerService Class Second, create a KafkaProducerService class and its implementation class KafkaProducerServiceImpl. We are using producer instance created by KafkaTemplate to send kafka message to given kafka topic.\nPlease read more about KafkaTemplate which comes with overloaded send method to send messages with key, partition and routing information.\npackage com.abc.demo.service; public interface KafkaProducerService { public void send(String topic, String data); } package com.abc.demo.service; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.kafka.core.KafkaTemplate; import org.springframework.stereotype.Service; @Service public class KafkaProducerServiceImpl implements KafkaProducerService { @Autowired private KafkaTemplate\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; kafkaTemplate; @Override public void send(String topic, String data) { kafkaTemplate.send(topic, data); } } \nSpring Boot Kafka Consumer If you want to create a consumer service to receive messages from a single Kafka topic or multiple Kafka topics then you need to create two Classes,\nCreate KafkaConsumerConfig Class First, create a KafkaConsumerConfig class which uses consumer configuration defined in application.yml and define a ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory bean which is responsible to create listener for given Kafka bootstrap server. We have also used @EnableKafka annotation at class level which tells spring boot to detect @KafkaListener annotation applied to any method in spring boot application. We will use this annotation in our consumer service class.\npackage com.abc.demo.config; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; import org.apache.kafka.common.config.SslConfigs; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration; import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.EnableKafka; import org.springframework.kafka.config.ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory; import org.springframework.kafka.core.ConsumerFactory; import org.springframework.kafka.core.DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory; @EnableKafka @Configuration public class KafkaConsumerConfig { @Autowired private ConsumerFactory\u0026lt;Integer, String\u0026gt; consumerFactory; public Map\u0026lt;String, Object\u0026gt; consumerConfig(){ Map\u0026lt;String, Object\u0026gt; kafkaAutoConfig = ((DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory\u0026lt;Integer, String\u0026gt;) consumerFactory).getConfigurationProperties(); Map\u0026lt;String, Object\u0026gt; consumerConfig = new HashMap\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); consumerConfig.putAll(kafkaAutoConfig); consumerConfig.compute(SslConfigs.SSL_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD_CONFIG, (k,v) -\u0026gt; (String)v); consumerConfig.compute(SslConfigs.SSL_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_CONFIG, (k,v) -\u0026gt; String)v); consumerConfig.compute(SslConfigs.SSL_KEY_PASSWORD_CONFIG, (k,v) -\u0026gt; (String)v); return consumerConfig; } @Bean public ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; kafkaListenerContainerFactory(){ ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory\u0026lt;String, String\u0026gt; factory = new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); factory.setConsumerFactory(new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(consumerConfig())); return factory; } } \nCreate KafkaConsumerService Class Second, create a KafkaConsumerService class and its implementation class KafkaConsumerServiceImpl. We have used @KafkaListener annotation at method passing kafka consumer topic names, which will be detected by spring boot application automatically. You will be able to consumer messages from kafka topic using this method.\npackage com.abc.demo.service; public interface KafkaConsumerService { public void receive(String data); } package com.abc.demo.service; import org.slf4j.Logger; import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory; import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener; import org.springframework.messaging.handler.annotation.Payload; import org.springframework.stereotype.Service; @Service public class KafkaConsumerServiceImpl implements KafkaConsumerService{ private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(KafkaConsumerServiceImpl.class); @KafkaListener(topics = {\u0026#34;#{\u0026#39;${spring.kafka.consumer.topic}\u0026#39;.split(\u0026#39;,\u0026#39;)}\u0026#34;}) public void receive(@Payload String data) { logger.info(\u0026#34;data: {}\u0026#34;, data); } } \nSummary Spring boot provides a wrapper over kafka producer and consumer implementation in Java which helps us to easily configure-\n Kafka Producer using KafkaTemplate which provides overloaded send method to send messages in multiple ways with keys, partitions and routing information. Kafka Consumer using @EnableKafka annotation which auto detects @KafkaListener annotation applied to any method and that methods becomes a Kafka Listener.

In this post we will talk about why we should use async/wait, its syntax and practical usage with example.\nWhy Async/Await? In earlier days, you would have used callbacks to handle asynchronous operations. However, callbacks have limited functionality and often leads to unmanageable code if you are handling multiple async calls, it leads to heavily nested callback code which is also known as callback hell.\nLater, Promises were introduced in ES6 to overcome the problems of callback functions and improved code readability. Finally Async/Await introduced in ES2017, which are nothing but the syntactic improved version of promises. Its underlying is Promise with improved syntax which provides,\n better way to chain promises and pass values between chained promises more concise and readable code compare to promises debugging is easy better error handling   Also read this post for more details on promises in javascript\n Syntax async When async keyword is applied before a function, it turns into asynchronous function and always return a promise object.\n1async function hello() { 2 //return Promise.resolve(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;); 3 return \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;; 4} 5 6console.log(hello()); 7hello().then(data =\u0026gt; console.log(data)); Output Promise {\u0026lt;resolved\u0026gt;: \u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;} Hello We see in above code snippet that when we execute async function hello(), it wraps the string value in promise object and return a resolved promise. We can also explicitly return the resolved promise object, line 2 and line 3 are same.\nWe further used then on resolved promise object to get Hello string (line 7)\nawait // works only inside async functions let value = await promise; await keyword works only inside async function and it makes the function execution wait until the returned promise settles (either resolve or reject).\n1async function hello() { 2 let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u0026gt; { 3 setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; resolve(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;), 5000) 4 }); 5 6 let value = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves 7 8 return value; 9} 10 11hello().then(data =\u0026gt; console.log(data)); Please note that in above code snippet when we execute async function hello(), function execution literally waits for 5s at line 6 before returning resolved promise object. CPU resources are not utilized in this wait period and can be used for other work.\nAlso note that if you use await keyword inside non-async function, it returns SyntaxError like below:\nfunction hello() { let promise = Promise.resolve(\u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot;); let value = await promise; ⓧ Uncaught SyntaxError: await is only valid in async function return value; } Usage Let\u0026rsquo;s see one of the practical example of getting data from multiple HTTP endpoints using fetch API.\n1. Create three promise objects We have created a common function getData and used this to create three parameterized promise objects getUser, getPosts and getComments to fetch data from their respective HTTP endpoint.\n//create a common getData function let getData = (url) =\u0026gt; new Promise(function (resolve, reject ){ fetch(url) .then(response =\u0026gt; { return response.json(); }) .then(data =\u0026gt; { resolve(data); }) .catch(error =\u0026gt; { reject(error); }); }); //create multiple promises from common getData function let getUsers = getData(\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users\u0026#39;); let getPosts = (userId) =\u0026gt; getData(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=${userId}`); let getComments = (postId) =\u0026gt; getData(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments?postId=${postId}`); \n2.

Further chaining it with getComments promise by passing firstPost.\n//promise chaining of multiple asynchronous calls getUsers.then(users =\u0026gt; { let firstUser = users[0]; return getPosts(firstUser.id); }).then(posts =\u0026gt; { let firstPost = posts[0]; return getComments(firstPost.id); }).then(comments =\u0026gt; { console.log(comments); }).catch(error =\u0026gt; console.error(error)); Output ▼ (5) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}] ➤ 0: {postId: 1, id: 1, name: \u0026quot;id labore ex et quam laborum\u0026quot;, email: \u0026quot;Eliseo@gardner.biz\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;laudantium enim quasi est quidem magnam voluptate …utem quasi↵reiciendis et nam sapiente accusantium\u0026quot;} ➤ 1: {postId: 1, id: 2, name: \u0026quot;quo vero reiciendis velit similique earum\u0026quot;, email: \u0026quot;Jayne_Kuhic@sydney.com\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;est natus enim nihil est dolore omnis voluptatem n…iatur↵nihil sint nostrum voluptatem reiciendis et\u0026quot;} ➤ 2: {postId: 1, id: 3, name: \u0026quot;odio adipisci rerum aut animi\u0026quot;, email: \u0026quot;Nikita@garfield.biz\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;quia molestiae reprehenderit quasi aspernatur↵aut …mus et vero voluptates excepturi deleniti ratione\u0026quot;} ➤ 3: {postId: 1, id: 4, name: \u0026quot;alias odio sit\u0026quot;, email: \u0026quot;Lew@alysha.tv\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;non et atque↵occaecati deserunt quas accusantium u…r itaque dolor↵et qui rerum deleniti ut occaecati\u0026quot;} ➤ 4: {postId: 1, id: 5, name: \u0026quot;vero eaque aliquid doloribus et culpa\u0026quot;, email: \u0026quot;Hayden@althea.biz\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;harum non quasi et ratione↵tempore iure ex volupta…ugit inventore cupiditate↵voluptates magni quo et\u0026quot;} length: 5 ➤ __proto__: Array(0) \n3. async/await Let\u0026rsquo;s achieve the same goal of fetching comments using async/await,\n//async and await makes code cleaner and readable async function getCommentsOfFirstPostByFirstUser(){ let users = await getUsers; let firstUser = users[0]; let posts = await getPosts(firstUser.id); let firstPost = posts[0]; let comments = await getComments(firstPost.id); return comments; } getCommentsOfFirstPostByFirstUser().then(comments =\u0026gt; console.log(comments)); Output ▼ (5) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}] ➤ 0: {postId: 1, id: 1, name: \u0026quot;id labore ex et quam laborum\u0026quot;, email: \u0026quot;Eliseo@gardner.biz\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;laudantium enim quasi est quidem magnam voluptate …utem quasi↵reiciendis et nam sapiente accusantium\u0026quot;} ➤ 1: {postId: 1, id: 2, name: \u0026quot;quo vero reiciendis velit similique earum\u0026quot;, email: \u0026quot;Jayne_Kuhic@sydney.com\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;est natus enim nihil est dolore omnis voluptatem n…iatur↵nihil sint nostrum voluptatem reiciendis et\u0026quot;} ➤ 2: {postId: 1, id: 3, name: \u0026quot;odio adipisci rerum aut animi\u0026quot;, email: \u0026quot;Nikita@garfield.biz\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;quia molestiae reprehenderit quasi aspernatur↵aut …mus et vero voluptates excepturi deleniti ratione\u0026quot;} ➤ 3: {postId: 1, id: 4, name: \u0026quot;alias odio sit\u0026quot;, email: \u0026quot;Lew@alysha.tv\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;non et atque↵occaecati deserunt quas accusantium u…r itaque dolor↵et qui rerum deleniti ut occaecati\u0026quot;} ➤ 4: {postId: 1, id: 5, name: \u0026quot;vero eaque aliquid doloribus et culpa\u0026quot;, email: \u0026quot;Hayden@althea.biz\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;harum non quasi et ratione↵tempore iure ex volupta…ugit inventore cupiditate↵voluptates magni quo et\u0026quot;} length: 5 ➤ __proto__: Array(0) Summary We see that async/await are much easier to use as compare to promises.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/async-await-in-javascript/","tags":["Javascript Interview","Javascript ES6"],"title":"Async/Await in JavaScript"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"Promises are introduced natively in ES6. They are very similar to our promises. As we keep or break our promises, Javascript promises are also either resolve or reject. In this post we will talk about why we should use promises, promise syntax, promise states and its practical usage with examples using fetch API.\nWhy Promises? In earlier days, you would have used callbacks to handle asynchronous operations. However, callbacks have limited functionality and often leads to unmanageable code if you are handling multiple async calls, it leads to heavily nested callback code which is also known as callback hell.\nPromises were introduced to improve code readability and better handling of async calls and errors.\nPromise Syntax Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the syntax of simple promise object.\nlet promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { // asynchronous call }); Promise takes a callback function as an argument and that callback function takes two arguments — the first is a resolve function, and the second one is a reject function. A promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason (error).\nPromise States A promise object has one of three states:\n pending: is the initial state. fulfilled: is success state. resolve() method is called. rejected: is failed state, reject() is called.   Usage We generally use async calls using fetch API to get data from the HTTP endpoints. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the example, how promises can be used in such case.\n//create a promise object let getUsers = new Promise(function (resolve, reject ){ fetch(\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users\u0026#39;) .then(response =\u0026gt; { return response.json(); }) .then(data =\u0026gt; { resolve(data); }) .catch(error =\u0026gt; { reject(error); }); }); //call promise object getUsers .then((data) =\u0026gt; { console.log(data); }) .catch(error =\u0026gt; { console.log(error); }); Chained Promises Promise chaining comes into play when you have to use output of one async call as input of another async call. You can chain multiple promises in this case.\nLet’s look at the below example where we first fetch users list using getUser async call then chain it with getPosts by passing userId.\n//create a common getData function let getData = (url) =\u0026gt; new Promise(function (resolve, reject ){ fetch(url) .then(response =\u0026gt; { return response.json(); }) .then(data =\u0026gt; { resolve(data); }) .catch(error =\u0026gt; { reject(error); }); }); let getUsers = getData(\u0026#39;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users\u0026#39;); let getPosts = (userId) =\u0026gt; getData(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=${userId}`); //chained promises to fetch all posts by first user (userId = 1) getUsers.then((data) =\u0026gt; { const user = data[0]; return getPosts(user.id); }) .then((data) =\u0026gt; { console.log(data); }) .catch(error =\u0026gt; { console.log(error); }); Output ▼ (10) [{…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}, {…}] ➤ 0: {userId: 1, id: 1, title: \u0026quot;sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;quia et suscipit↵suscipit recusandae consequuntur …strum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto\u0026quot;} ➤ 1: {userId: 1, id: 2, title: \u0026quot;qui est esse\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;est rerum tempore vitae↵sequi sint nihil reprehend…aperiam non debitis possimus qui neque nisi nulla\u0026quot;} ➤ 2: {userId: 1, id: 3, title: \u0026quot;ea molestias quasi exercitationem repellat qui ipsa sit aut\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;et iusto sed quo iure↵voluptatem occaecati omnis e…↵molestiae porro eius odio et labore et velit aut\u0026quot;} ➤ 3: {userId: 1, id: 4, title: \u0026quot;eum et est occaecati\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;ullam et saepe reiciendis voluptatem adipisci↵sit … ipsam iure↵quis sunt voluptatem rerum illo velit\u0026quot;} ➤ 4: {userId: 1, id: 5, title: \u0026quot;nesciunt quas odio\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;repudiandae veniam quaerat sunt sed↵alias aut fugi…sse voluptatibus quis↵est aut tenetur dolor neque\u0026quot;} ➤ 5: {userId: 1, id: 6, title: \u0026quot;dolorem eum magni eos aperiam quia\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;ut aspernatur corporis harum nihil quis provident …s↵voluptate dolores velit et doloremque molestiae\u0026quot;} ➤ 6: {userId: 1, id: 7, title: \u0026quot;magnam facilis autem\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;dolore placeat quibusdam ea quo vitae↵magni quis e…t excepturi ut quia↵sunt ut sequi eos ea sed quas\u0026quot;} ➤ 7: {userId: 1, id: 8, title: \u0026quot;dolorem dolore est ipsam\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;dignissimos aperiam dolorem qui eum↵facilis quibus…↵ipsam ut commodi dolor voluptatum modi aut vitae\u0026quot;} ➤ 8: {userId: 1, id: 9, title: \u0026quot;nesciunt iure omnis dolorem tempora et accusantium\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;consectetur animi nesciunt iure dolore↵enim quia a…st aut quod aut provident voluptas autem voluptas\u0026quot;} ➤ 9: {userId: 1, id: 10, title: \u0026quot;optio molestias id quia eum\u0026quot;, body: \u0026quot;quo et expedita modi cum officia vel magni↵dolorib…it↵quos veniam quod sed accusamus veritatis error\u0026quot;} length: 10 ➤ __proto__: Array(0) Promise.all() Promise.all() is useful when you want to execute multiple async calls and wait for all of them to finish and get collective output.\nPromise.all() takes an array of promises and return an array of the results in the same sequence of promises.

Javascript - operator always behaves as number operator. if any one or both of the operands are string, Javascript attempts to convert it to a number, if not able to convert then return NaN.\nRelational Operators. Guess the output ? console.log( 10 \u0026lt; 20 \u0026lt; 30 ); console.log( 30 \u0026gt; 20 \u0026gt; 10 ); Have you guessed true in both the cases ? No, its not correct.\nOutput true false The output is true and false. Here is the explanation,\nIn Javascript relational operators are evaluated from left to right, false equals 0, and true equals 1 for number comparisons.\nSo comparison evaluation is something like this,\n10 \u0026lt; 20 \u0026lt; 30 =\u0026gt; true \u0026lt; 30 =\u0026gt; 1 \u0026lt; 30 =\u0026gt; true 30 \u0026gt; 20 \u0026gt; 10 =\u0026gt; true \u0026gt; 10 =\u0026gt; 1 \u0026gt; 10 =\u0026gt; false  Comparison Operators. Guess the output ? console.log( null == 0 ); console.log( null \u0026gt; 0 ); console.log( null \u0026gt;= 0 ); You might have guessed false in all the three cases but its not correct.\nOutput false false true In Javascript, equality check == and comparisons \u0026gt; \u0026lt; \u0026gt;= \u0026lt;= behaves differently.\nFor equality comparison,\n null and undefined are comparable. 0, false and \u0026quot;\u0026quot; (empty string) are comparable. null and 0 are not comparable so null == 0 returns false.  For number comparison,\n if one operand is number, it attempts to convert other operand to number. null becomes 0 and undefined becomes NaN for number comparison so null \u0026gt; 0 returns false whereas null \u0026gt;= 0 returns true.  forEach loop. Guess the output? const elements = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; elements.forEach(element =\u0026gt; { console.log(element); if(element == 2){ return; //break;  //continue;  } }) Have you guessed it will print 1 and 2 ? Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the output,\nOutput 1 2 3 4 5 Yes, its confusing in Javascript. The reason is that we are passing a callback function in forEach loop which will be executed for each element no matter if we return.\nIf you use break or continue instead of return, you get either one of the error since these are not applicable for a callback function:\nUncaught SyntaxError: Illegal break statement Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal continue statement From Official MDN docs:\nThere is no way to stop or break a forEach loop other than throwing an exception. If you need such behavior, the forEach method is the wrong tool. Early termination may be accomplished with:\n A simple for loop A for...of / for...in loops  Variable hoisting. Guess the output? var foo = 1; function myFun(){ console.log(foo); var foo = 2; } myFun(); Have you guessed foo = 1 or foo = 2?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s neither one of them. It will print undefined. Here is the explanation,\nHoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.\nLet’s see how it is interpreted by the compiler in hoisting process,\nvar foo; foo = 1; function myFun(){ var foo; // var hoisted and initialized with undefined console.log(foo); // undefined foo = 2; } myFun(); Closure. Guess the output? for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++) { setTimeout(function() { console.log(i); }, i*1000); } Have you guessed it will print 0, 1, 2 after every 1 second ? Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the output,\nOutput 3 3 3 Actually it will print 3, 3, 3 after every 1 second. This is because of JavaScript Closure. Here is the explanation,\nclosure A JavaScript closure is when an inner function has access to its outer function\u0026rsquo;s scope. In the following line of code:\nsetTimeout(function() { console.log(i); }, i*1000);  variable i is used in an inner function whereas it is actually declared in outer for loop. Inner function will be able to access the value of i through Closure.\nhoisting In Javascript hoisting process, declaration of i will be moved to the top of their scope, since i is defined using var in for loop, declaration of i will be moved to global scope in hoisting process.\nAfter three iteration of for loop, value of global scoped variable i will be 3. All three closures will refer to this same i variable from global scope.\nlet if i were defined using let instead of var in for loop, output would have been different. Why?\nlet is block scoped as opposed to var which is function scoped. Since for loop is also a block, value of i in each iteration is block scoped within that iteration and each closure has its own copy of i variable. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the code,\nfor (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++) { setTimeout(function() { console.log(i); }, i*1000); } Output 0 1 2 this keyword. Guess the output? var a = new Person(\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;); var b = Person var c = Person(\u0026#34;c\u0026#34;); function Person(fname) { this.fname = fname; } console.log(\u0026#34;1.\u0026#34;, fname); console.log(\u0026#34;2.\u0026#34;, a.fname); console.log(\u0026#34;3.\u0026#34;, b.fname); console.log(\u0026#34;4.\u0026#34;, c.fname); Think for a while before looking at the output.\nOutput 1. c 2. a 3. undefined Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fname' of undefined Here is the explanation,\n fname will print c. When you execute Person(\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;) function, this refers to global object window and this.fname is assigned value as c. a.fname will print a. When you execute function using new keyword new Person(\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;), this refers to newly created object. b.fname will print undefined since you are just assigning a function object and not executing it. Person object is not having property named as fname function Person(\u0026quot;c\u0026quot;) doesn\u0026rsquo;t return anything so c is undefined and c.fname will throw error   Also read this post to understand all about this keyword with examples\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/tricky-javascript-interview-questions/","tags":["Interview Q\u0026A","JavaScript Q\u0026A"],"title":"Tricky Javascript Interview Questions"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"This is frequently asked question in JavaScript interview. We can compare primitive types, array and object using two comparison operators == and === available in JavaScript. This post describes the difference between these two with many examples.\n\u0026ldquo;==\u0026rdquo; operator  == is also known as abstract comparison operator which compares only content of operand and not type. == attempts to convert the operands to compatible type before comparison. String and number with same content are equal. == converts the string to number before comparison. 0, false and empty string \u0026quot;\u0026quot; are comparable and equal. null and undefined are comparable and equal. Two arrays with exactly same elements are not equal because both refers to different object in memory. Similarly two objects with exactly same properties are not equals because both refers to different object in memory.  \u0026ldquo;===\u0026rdquo; operator  === is also known as strict comparison operator which compares both content and its type. === does not attempt to convert the operand to compatible types before comparison and compare directly. It has better performance compare to == Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal (have the same number value). NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN. Confusing in JavaScript. Positive zero (+0) and negative zero (-0) are strictly equal. Confusing in JavaScript since content is different. Two boolean values are strictly equal only if both either true or false. Two objects are strictly equal only if they refer to the same Object. null only strictly equals to null undefined only strictly equals to undefined  Compare \u0026ldquo;==\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;===\u0026rdquo; console.log(\u0026#34;cnc\u0026#34; == \u0026#34;cnc\u0026#34;); // true, same content and type console.log(\u0026#34;cnc\u0026#34; === \u0026#34;cnc\u0026#34;); // true, same content and type  console.log(12345 == 12345); // true, same content and type console.log(12345 === 12345); // true, same content and type  console.log(false == false); // true, same content and type console.log(false === false); // true, same content and type  console.log(12345 == \u0026#34;12345\u0026#34;); // true, comparable and equal console.log(12345 === \u0026#34;12345\u0026#34;); // false, different type  console.log(0 == false); // true, comparable and equal console.log(0 === false); // false, different type  console.log(\u0026#34;\u0026#34; == false); // true, comparable and equal console.log(\u0026#34;\u0026#34; === false); // false, different type  console.log(null == undefined); // true, comparable and equal console.log(null === undefined); // false, different type  console.log([] == []); // false, both refers to different object in memory console.log([] === []); // false, both refers to different object in memory  console.log([1, 2] == [1, 2]); // false, both refers to different object in memory console.log([1, 2] === [1, 2]); // false, both refers to different object in memory  console.log({} == {}); // false, both refers to different object in memory console.log({} === {}); // false, both refers to different object in memory  var array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; var array2 = array1; console.log(array1 == array2); // true, both refers to same array console.log(array1 === array2); // true, both refers to same array  var obj1 = { app : \u0026#34;cnc\u0026#34;}; var obj2 = obj1; console.log(obj1 == obj2); // true, both refers to same object console.log(obj1 === obj2); // true, both refers to same object  console.log(+0 == -0); // true, confusing, content is different console.log(+0 === -0); // true, confusing, content is different  console.log(NaN == NaN); // false, confusing, content and type is same console.log(NaN === NaN); // false, confusing, content and type is same The last two comparisons are very confusing in Javascript, Remember always\n NaN is not equal to NaN +0 is equal to -0  Also remember, === is recommended to use for comparison where ever possible as it is faster then == in terms of performance.\nObject.is() ES6 has introduced a new method Object.is() to compare two values, let\u0026rsquo;s check it out\nconsole.log(Object.is(\u0026#34;cnc\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cnc\u0026#34;)); // true, same content and type console.log(Object.is(12345, 12345)); // true, same content and type console.log(Object.is(false, false)); // true, same content and type  console.log(Object.is(12345, \u0026#34;12345\u0026#34;)); // false, different type console.log(Object.is(0, false)); // false, different type console.log(Object.is(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, false)); // false, different type console.log(Object.is(null, undefined)); // false, different type  console.log(Object.is([], [])); // false, both refers to different object in memory console.log(Object.is([1, 2], [1, 2])); // false, both refers to different object in memory console.log(Object.is({}, {})); // false, both refers to different object in memory  var array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; var array2 = array1; console.log(Object.is(array1, array2)); // true, both refers to same array  var obj1 = { app : \u0026#34;cnc\u0026#34;}; var obj2 = obj1; console.log(Object.is(obj1, obj2)); // true, both refers to same object  console.log(Object.is(+0, -0)); // false, es6 is good, different content console.log(Object.is(NaN, NaN)); // true, es6 is good, same content and type You see that Object.is() makes the NaN and +0/-0 comparison less confusing.\nSummary Where == compares only content, === compares both content and type of operands. Strict comparison operator === does not attempt to convert the operands to compatible types and provide better performance as compare to abstract comparison operator ==.\nLast, Object.is() introduced in ES6 works very much similar to strict operator === and also avoid confusion of NaN comparisons and +0/-0 comparisons. It is recommended to use Object.is().\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/comparison-operators-in-javascript/","tags":["Javascript Interview","Javascript Operator"],"title":"Difference in == and === comparison operators in JavaScript"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"The this keyword in JavaScript is very important concept but at the same time very confusing to understand.\nIn JavaScript, this keyword refers to the object it belongs to.

In a function, this refers to the global object. In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined. When a function called with new keyword, this refers to new object instance In a DOM event, this refers to the element that received the event. Function prototype methods call(), apply() and bind() can be used to refer this to any object.  this in a Method  When you execute a method of an object, this refers to the object where method is defined.\nIn the below example this refers to the person object since fullName() method is defined inside person object.\nvar person = { firstName: \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;, lastName : \u0026#34;Doe\u0026#34;, fullName : function() { return this.firstName + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + this.lastName; } }; console.log(person.fullName()); // John Doe Let\u0026rsquo;s see one more example below where obj1 and obj2 are executing their own increment() methods so here this refers to obj1 and obj2 respectively\nvar increment = function(){ return console.log(this.a + 1); } var obj1 = { a: 1, increment: increment }; var obj2 = { a: 2, increment: increment }; obj1.increment(); //this = obj1 obj2.increment(); //this = obj2 Output 2 3 this Alone  When you use this alone, it refers to global object\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try what is the value of this when used alone:\nconsole.log(this); //this = window Output Window {parent: Window, opener: null, top: Window, length: 4, frames: Window, …} We see that this refers to Window object, which is global object of browser.\nRemember: In strict mode, when used alone, this also refers to the global object.\nthis in a Function (default)  For a function (which is at top level or not inside any function), this refers to global object.\nfunction topLevelFunction(){ console.log(this); } topLevelFunction(); //this = window In the above case this refers to the global object window of browser\nthis in a Function (strict)  However, for a function (which is at top level or not inside any function) in strict mode, this refers to undefined\nLook at the below example where this refers to undefined in strict mode function:\n\u0026#39;use strict\u0026#39;; function topLevelFunction(){ console.log(this); } topLevelFunction(); //this = undefined one more example, where increment() function is called in strict mode, this refers to undefined and throw error.\nvar a = 1; var increment = function(){ \u0026#39;use strict\u0026#39;; return console.log(this.a + 1); } increment(); //this = undefined Output Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'a' of undefined this with new  When a function is called using new keyword, then the function is known as a constructor function and returns a new object. In this case, this refers to a newly created object.\nvar Person = function(firstName, lastName){ this.firstName = firstName; this.lastName = lastName; this.getFullName = function(){ console.log(`${this.firstName}${this.lastName}`); } } let person1 = new Person(\u0026#34;Albert\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Einstein\u0026#34;); let person2 = new Person(\u0026#34;Isaac\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Newton\u0026#34;); person1.getFullName(); //this = person1 person2.getFullName(); //this = person2 Output Albert Einstein Isaac Newton this with Explicit binding  Function has call(), apply() and bind() prototype methods which can be called on function to change the context of this explictly.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at these methods one by one and also see the differences\ncall() ƒ.call(this, arg1, arg2, ...)  When a function is called using call() method,\n first argument is referred by this subsequent comma separated arguments are method arguments   Remember: “call() arguments are separated by commas”.\n apply() ƒ.apply(this, [arg1, arg2, ...])  When a function is called using apply() method,\n first argument is referred by this second argument is an array of values, are method arguments   Remember: “apply() accepts arguments as an Array”\n bind() ƒ.bind(this)  When a function is called using bind() method\n argument passed to bind() function is referred by this returns new bind function whose context is passed argument   Remember: “bind() method doesn\u0026rsquo;t call the function.

They are defined using static keyword and often used to create utility functions.  class Car { constructor(brand, color, price) { this._brand = brand; this._color = color; this._price = price; } // getter method  get color(){ return `color is ${this._color.toUpperCase()}`; } // setter method  set color(newColor){ this._color = newColor; } // prototype method  drive(){ return `driving ${this._brand}${this._color}color car`; } // static method  static compareCars(car1, car2){ return `${car2._brand}is ${(car1._price \u0026gt; car2._price) ? \u0026#34;cheaper\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;costlier\u0026#34;}then ${car1._brand}` } } Let\u0026rsquo;s create some objects using Car class and call their getter, setter, prototype and static methods\nlet redToyotaCar = new Car(\u0026#34;Toyota\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, 500000); console.log(redToyotaCar); // prints Car {_brand: \u0026#34;Toyota\u0026#34;, _color: \u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, _price: 500000}  console.log(redToyotaCar.color); // (getter method) // prints \u0026#39;color is RED\u0026#39;  console.log(redToyotaCar.drive()); // (prototype method) // prints \u0026#39;driving Toyota red color car\u0026#39;  redToyotaCar.color = \u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;; // (setter method) // set color to blue  console.log(redToyotaCar.color); // (getter method) // prints \u0026#39;color is BLUE\u0026#39;  console.log(redToyotaCar.drive()); // (prototype method) // prints \u0026#39;driving Toyota blue color car\u0026#39;  let blackAudiCar = new Car(\u0026#34;Audi\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;black\u0026#34;, 900000); console.log(Car.compareCars(redToyotaCar, blackAudiCar)); // (static method) // prints \u0026#39;Audi is costlier then Toyota\u0026#39; In our class above we have a getter and setter for our color property. We use _ convention to create a backing field to store our color property. Without this every time get or set is called it would cause a stack overflow. The get would be called and which would cause the get to be called again over and over creating an infinite loop.\nVM172:12 Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded at Car.set color [as color] (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:12:16) at Car.set color [as color] (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:12:16) at Car.set color [as color] (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:12:16) at Car.set color [as color] (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:12:16) at Car.set color [as color] (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:12:16) at Car.set color [as color] (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:12:16) at Car.set color [as color] (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:12:16) at Car.set color [as color] (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:12:16) at Car.set color [as color] (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:12:16) at Car.set color [as color] (\u0026lt;anonymous\u0026gt;:12:16) Inheritance Let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to create a Toyota subclass from Car class and add some additional fields like \u0026ldquo;model\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;make\u0026rdquo;.\nclass Toyota extends Car { constructor(color, price, model, make){ super(\u0026#34;Toyota\u0026#34;, color, price); Object.assign(this, {model, make}); } drive(){ return `${super.drive()}made in ${this.make}`; } } Let\u0026rsquo;s create some objects from Toyota subclass\nlet toyotaCamery = new Toyota(\u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, 800000, \u0026#34;Camary\u0026#34;, 2010); console.log(toyotaCamery); // prints Toyota {_brand: \u0026#34;Toyota\u0026#34;, _color: \u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, _price: 800000, model: \u0026#34;Camary\u0026#34;, make: 2010}  console.log(toyotaCamery.color); // prints \u0026#39;color is RED\u0026#39;  console.log(toyotaCamery.drive()); // prints \u0026#39;driving Toyota red color car made in 2010\u0026#39; We see that creating a subclass using ES6 class keyword is quite handy and easy.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/classes-in-javascript/","tags":["Javascript Interview","Javascript ES6"],"title":"Classes in JavaScript"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"This is frequently asked question in JavaScript interview. This post describes the Function prototype methods call(), apply() and bind() with their syntax, usage and practical examples.\nWhat is Function.prototype?  First of all we need to understand that all these three functions call, apply and bind are prototype of Function. What does that mean?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s print Function\u0026rsquo;s structure to understand it.\nconsole.dir(Function); ▼ ƒ Function() arguments: (...) caller: (...) length: 1 name: \u0026quot;Function\u0026quot; ▼ prototype: ƒ () arguments: (...) caller: (...) length: 0 name: \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ➤ constructor: ƒ Function() ➤ apply: ƒ apply() ➤ bind: ƒ bind() ➤ call: ƒ call() ➤ toString: ƒ toString() ➤ Symbol(Symbol.hasInstance): ƒ [Symbol.hasInstance]() ➤ get arguments: ƒ () ➤ set arguments: ƒ () ➤ get caller: ƒ () ➤ set caller: ƒ () You can see apply, bind and call are prototype functions of Function, that means you can use these three functions on any new function you define.\nWhen to use call(), bind() and apply()  When you define a new function and call it from somewhere in your code, it is executed in a context. This context is called this and it refers to an object. This object can vary depending upon how you called a function.\nvar a = 1; var increment = function(){ return console.log(this.a + 1); } var obj1 = { a: 2, increment: increment }; var obj2 = { a: 3, increment: increment }; increment(); //this = window obj1.increment(); //this = obj1 obj2.increment(); //this = obj2 Output 2 3 4 We can see in above code snippet that we called same increment() function in three different context which changes the this reference and resulting into three different output.\nHere,\n first increment() function is called in global context where this binds to global object. window is the global object if you are working in browser. next two increment() functions are called in implicit context where this binds to the object on which function is called. This is called implicit context because function is tightly coupled with object (defined inside object) and this reference binds to object at compile time when you call a function from object like obj.ƒn()  Sometime we may want to call a function in explicit context where we can control on this reference at runtime when calling a function. This is where call(), apply() and bind() comes into play. Let\u0026rsquo;s call the same increment() function using call(), apply() and bind() methods.\nvar increment = function(){ return console.log(this.a + 1); } var obj1 = { a: 4 }; var obj2 = { a: 5 }; increment.call(obj1); //this = obj1 increment.call(obj2); //this = obj2  increment.apply(obj1); //this = obj1 increment.apply(obj2); //this = obj2  var bindFn1 = increment.bind(obj1); var bindFn2 = increment.bind(obj2); bindFn1(); //this = obj1 bindFn2(); //this = obj2 Output 5 6 5 6 5 6 Few points to note from above code snippet:-\n All these three call(), apply() and bind() are prototype of Function so you are able to use them on any function increment.call(), increment.apply() and increment.bind(). All these three call(), apply() and bind() providing different object context (obj1, obj2) at runtime and resulting into different output. Where call() and apply() execute a function immediately, bind() returns a bound function which can be executed later.  Now that we have understood the basic usage of these prototype functions, let\u0026rsquo;s look at their syntax and practical usage with example.\ncall()  Syntax functionName.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)  When a function is called using call(),\n this refers to thisArg Comma separated arguments arg1, arg2 ... are the arguments of function   Remember: “call() arguments are separated by commas”.\n Practical Usage 1. Borrow functionality of other objects In Javascript, every object can have prototype functions which are actually meant to be executed only on that object. Using call() methods, you can borrow the functionality of these objects and execute it on different object.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the Array prototype functions\nconsole.dir(Array); ▼ ƒ Array() arguments: (...) caller: (...) length: 1 name: \u0026quot;Array\u0026quot; ▼ prototype: ƒ () length: 0 ➤ constructor: ƒ Array() ➤ concat: ƒ concat() ➤ copyWithin: ƒ copyWithin() ➤ fill: ƒ fill() ➤ find: ƒ find() ➤ findIndex: ƒ findIndex() ➤ lastIndexOf: ƒ lastIndexOf() ➤ pop: ƒ pop() ➤ push: ƒ push() ➤ reverse: ƒ reverse() ➤ shift: ƒ shift() ➤ unshift: ƒ unshift() ➤ slice: ƒ slice() ➤ sort: ƒ sort() ➤ splice: ƒ splice() ➤ includes: ƒ includes() ➤ indexOf: ƒ indexOf() ➤ join: ƒ join() ➤ keys: ƒ keys() ➤ entries: ƒ entries() ➤ values: ƒ values() ➤ forEach: ƒ forEach() ➤ filter: ƒ filter() ➤ flat: ƒ flat() ➤ flatMap: ƒ flatMap() ➤ map: ƒ map() ➤ every: ƒ every() ➤ some: ƒ some() ➤ reduce: ƒ reduce() ➤ reduceRight: ƒ reduceRight() ➤ toLocaleString: ƒ toLocaleString() ➤ toString: ƒ toString() Let\u0026rsquo;s borrow the functionality of Array prototype methods using call() function:-\nArray.prototype.concat.call([1,2,3], [4,5]); Array.prototype.join.call([1,2,3,4,5], \u0026#34;:\u0026#34;) Output [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 1:2:3:4:5 Similarly borrow the start functionality of car object to use it for aircraft\nvar car = { name: \u0026#39;car\u0026#39;, start: function() { console.log(\u0026#39;Start the \u0026#39; + this.name); }, speedup: function() { console.log(\u0026#39;Speed up the \u0026#39; + this.name) }, stop: function() { console.log(\u0026#39;Stop the \u0026#39; + this.name); } }; var aircraft = { name: \u0026#39;aircraft\u0026#39;, fly: function(){ console.log(\u0026#39;Fly\u0026#39;); } }; car.start.call(aircraft); Output Start the aircraft 2. Chaining constructors function Box(height, width) { this.height = height; this.width = width; } function Widget(height, width, color) { Box.call(this, height, width); this.color = color; } function Dialog(height, width, color, title) { Widget.call(this, height, width, color); this.title = title; } var dialog = new Dialog(\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;, 100, 200, \u0026#39;Title\u0026#39;); We can see in above code snippet how we can chain the constructors by calling parent constructor function in current this context\napply()  Syntax functionName.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2, ...])  When a function is called using apply() method,\n this refers to thisArg second argument is an array of values [arg1, arg2, ...], are the arguments of function   Remember: “apply() accepts arguments as an Array”\n Practical Usage Practical usage of apply() function is same as call() function. The only difference between them, apply() accepts args as an array whereas call() accepts args as comma separated values.\nWe can pass arguments as an array using apply() function to call any function which accepts args as comma separated values.\nMath.min(1, 2, 3, 4, 5); //args as comma separated Math.min.apply([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]); //args as an array bind()  Syntax functionName.bind(thisArg)  When a function is called using bind() method,\n this refers to thisArg returns new bound function which can be called later   Remember: “bind() doesn\u0026rsquo;t call the function immediately. It returns a new bound function which can be called later.\n Practical Usage 1. Bounded context var Button = function(content) { this.content = content; }; Button.prototype.click = function() { console.log(this.content + \u0026#39; clicked\u0026#39;); }; var myButton = new Button(\u0026#39;OK\u0026#39;); myButton.click(); var looseClick = myButton.click; looseClick(); // not bound, \u0026#39;this\u0026#39; is not myButton - it is the global object  var boundClick = myButton.click.bind(myButton); boundClick(); // bound, \u0026#39;this\u0026#39; is myButton Output OK clicked undefined clicked OK clicked 2. Binding functions with parameters var logProp = function(prop) { console.log(this[prop]); }; var Obj = { x : 5, y : 10 }; Obj.log = logProp.bind(Obj); Obj.logX = logProp.bind(Obj, \u0026#39;x\u0026#39;); //binding with prop x Obj.logY = logProp.bind(Obj, \u0026#39;y\u0026#39;); //binding with prop y  Obj.log(\u0026#39;x\u0026#39;); Obj.logX(); Obj.log(\u0026#39;y\u0026#39;); Obj.logY(); Output 5 5 10 10 Another example,\nvar sum = function(a, b) { return a + b; }; var add5 = sum.bind(null, 5); //add5 is binding function with a = 5 console.log(add5(10)); //b =10 Output 15 Call vs Bind vs Apply  Comparison between function objects, function calls, call, apply and bind:\n    time of function execution time of this binding     function object ƒ future future   function call ƒ() now now   ƒ.call() now now   ƒ.apply() now now   ƒ.bind() future now    Let\u0026rsquo;s look at last example of this post and use call(), apply() and bind() methods all together\nlet numObj1 = {num: 1}; let numObj2 = {num: 2}; let sumFn = function(...args){ console.log(this.num + args.reduce((a,b)=\u0026gt; a+b, 0)); } sumFn.call(numObj1, 1, 2, 3, 4); //this = numObj1 sumFn.call(numObj2, 1, 2, 3, 4); //this = numObj2  sumFn.apply(numObj1, [1,2,3,4]); //this = numObj1 sumFn.apply(numObj2, [1,2,3,4]); //this = numObj2  let sumBindFn1 = sumFn.bind(numObj1); // return Fn let sumBindFn2 = sumFn.bind(numObj2); // return Fn sumBindFn1(1, 2, 3, 4); //this = numObj1 sumBindFn2(1, 2, 3, 4); //this = numObj2 output: 11 12 11 12 11 12 ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/call-vs-bind-vs-apply/","tags":["Javascript Interview","Javascript Core"],"title":"Understand call, bind and apply methods in JavaScript"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"This post describes the Lexical Scope, Closures and Currying Function in JavaScript and their relations with examples.\nLexical Scope  Variables defined using var keywords are having function scope which means new scope is created everytime you create a new function.\nLexical scope is associated with function scope. Lexical scope of variables is defined by their position in source code. JavaScript resolves the variable starting at the innermost scope and searches outwards until it finds the variable it was looking for.\nvar me = \u0026#34;global\u0026#34;; function whoami(){ var me = \u0026#34;local\u0026#34;; function func() { return me; } return func; } console.log(me); // global console.log(whoami()()); // local The value of the variable me outside is global whereas if you execute function whoami() from outside, value is local\nClosures  Closure is very important concept and frequently asked in JavaScript interviews.\n A closure is an inner function having access to its outer function scope and all above scopes even when that function is executing outside of its outer function.\n When you define an inner function inside outer function, Closure is created at runtime for inner function bundled with outer function\u0026rsquo;s scope.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the example to understand Closures\nvar outerFunc = function(c){ var a = 1; var innerFunc = function(d) { var b = 2; var innerMostFunc = function(e) { return a + b + c + d + e; } return innerMostFunc; } return innerFunc; } console.dir(outerFunc(3)); //1. innerFunc console.dir(outerFunc(3)(4)); //2. innerMostFunc console.log(outerFunc(3)(4)(5)); //3. 15 Output ▼ ƒ innerFunc(c) length: 1 name: \u0026quot;innerFunc\u0026quot; arguments: null caller: null ➤ prototype: {constructor: ƒ} ➤ __proto__: ƒ () [[FunctionLocation]]: ▼ [[Scopes]]: Scopes[2] ➤ 0: Closure (outerFunc) {c: 3, a: 1} ➤ 1: Global {parent: Window, opener: null, top: Window, length: 1, frames: Window, …} ▼ ƒ innerMostFunc(c) length: 1 name: \u0026quot;innerMostFunc\u0026quot; arguments: null caller: null ➤ prototype: {constructor: ƒ} ➤ __proto__: ƒ () [[FunctionLocation]]: ▼ [[Scopes]]: Scopes[3] ➤ 0: Closure (innerFunc) {d: 4, b: 2} ➤ 1: Closure (outerFunc) {c: 3, a: 1} ➤ 2: Global {parent: Window, opener: null, top: Window, length: 1, frames: Window, …} 15 We have three console dir/log.

It also has introduced the functional programming in Java. We will discuss different stream operations available in Collection, Array, IntStream with examples. We will also discuss the difference between Intermediate and Terminal operations.\nStream Operations  There are mainly three parts of any stream operations:-\n1. Create Stream These are called as Stream operation, which creates a stream from a given range or collection.\nList\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;.stream(), List\u0026lt;Object\u0026gt;.stream(), Arrays.stream(), IntStream.of(), IntStream.range()\n2. Process the Stream These are called as Intermediate operation, which converts a stream to another stream as a result. They can be chained together to form a pipeline of Stream operations.\nfilter(), map(), flatMap(), sorted(), distinct(), limit(), skip()\n3. Consume the Stream These are called as Terminal operation, which converts a stream to result or collection or void. They can not be chained together. Any Stream operation pipeline must end with terminal operation.\nforEach(), collect(), reduce(), min(), max(), count(), average(), sum(), anyMatch(), allMatch(), noneMatch(), findFirst(), findAny()\nIntermediate vs Terminal Operations 1. Output: Output of intermediate operation is another stream whereas output of terminal operation is a collection, array or primitive.\n2. Chaining: Stream operation pipeline can have as many as intermediate operators chained together but pipeline must end with terminal operator.\n3. Lazy Evaluation: Intermediate operations are evaluated lazily whereas terminal operations are eager. The intermediate operations just remain as a pipeline, and executed only when the terminal operation is executed\n4. Pipeline: Stream operations pipeline can have many intermediate operations but only one terminal operation.\nList\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;.stream() We will look at various stream operations pipelines.

List Collectors (Terminal Operations) Let\u0026rsquo;s look at various collectors (terminal operations) available:-\nList\u0026lt;Employee\u0026gt; employees = getAllEmployees(); // to list List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; listOfEmps = employees.stream() .limit(3) .map(Employee::getName) .collect(Collectors.toList()); // to set Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; setOfEmps = employees.stream() .limit(3) .map(Employee::getName) .collect(Collectors.toSet()); // to map Map\u0026lt;String, Employee\u0026gt; mapOfEmps = employees.stream() .limit(3) .collect(Collectors.toMap(e -\u0026gt; e.name, e -\u0026gt; e)); // john, amy, marcy String names = employees.stream() .limit(3) .map(Employee::getName) .collect(Collectors.joining(\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;)); // group by dept Map\u0026lt;String, List\u0026lt;Employee\u0026gt;\u0026gt; empByDept = employees.stream() .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(e -\u0026gt; e.dept)); // count employees in each dept Map\u0026lt;String, Long\u0026gt; countByDept = employees.stream() .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDept, Collectors.counting()));  Example 3. Parallel Operations Stream operations are executed sequentially by default. You can initiate parallel stream operations by using .parallel() operation. It is recommended to user parallel operation only when List is considerably large otherwise there will be a performance hit.\n// parallel stream Map\u0026lt;String, List\u0026lt;Employee\u0026gt;\u0026gt; empMapByDept = employees.stream() .parallel() .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(e -\u0026gt; e.dept));  IntStream.of() | .range()  Example 1. Run a for loop from 1 to n-1 int n = 6; IntStream.range(1, n) .forEach(System.out::println); Output 1 2 3 4 5  Example 2. Get min, max, avg, count, and sum of given Array Find the minimum of given number array:-\nint[] nums = {4, 1, 13, 90, 16, 2, 0}; int min = IntStream.of(nums) //create stream  .min() .getAsInt(); System.out.println(\u0026#34;min: \u0026#34; + min); Output min: 0 getAsInt() throw exception if min cannot be found e.g. if array is empty. Alternate method is ifPresent()\nIntStream.of(new int[0]) .min() .ifPresent(min -\u0026gt; System.out.println(min)); // OR IntStream.of(new int[0]) .min() .ifPresent(System.out::println); We changed the lambda expression min -\u0026gt; System.out.println(min) to double colon System.out::println in later version. Both do the same thing.\nOther similar statistics operations are:-\nint[] nums = {4, 1, 13, 90, 16, 2, 0}; int min = IntStream.of(nums).min().getAsInt(); int max = IntStream.of(nums).max().getAsInt(); double avg = IntStream.of(nums).average().getAsDouble(); long count = IntStream.of(nums).count(); long sum = IntStream.of(nums).sum(); Alternatively you can create a stream only once do get all statistics:-\nIntSummaryStatistics stats = IntStream.of(nums).summaryStatistics(); int min = stats.getMin(); int max = stats.getMax(); double avg = stats.getAverage(); long count = stats.getCount(); long sum = stats.getSum();  Example 3. Find 3 distinct smallest numbers from given Array int[] nums = {4, 1, 13, 90, 16, 2, 0}; IntStream.of(nums) .distinct() .sorted() .limit(3) .forEach(System.out::println); Output 0 1 2 Make note that streams works on the copy of the array and do not mutate the original array.\nYou can change the terminal (last) operation say if we want sum of 3 distinct small numbers:-\nint[] nums = {4, 1, 13, 90, 16, 2, 0}; long sum = IntStream.of(nums) .distinct() .sorted() .limit(3) .sum();  Example 4. All possible operations on IntStream Create a Stream IntStream.of(numbers); // from Array IntStream.range(1, 101); // 1..100 IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 100); // 1..100 IntStream.generate(supplier()); // from supplier Process the Stream IntStream.of(numbers).distinct(); // distinct IntStream.of(numbers).sorted(); // sort IntStream.of(numbers).limit(3); // get first 3 IntStream.of(numbers).skip(3); // skip first 3 IntStream.of(numbers).filter(n -\u0026gt; n%2==0); // only even IntStream.of(numbers).map(n -\u0026gt; n*2); // double each num IntStream.of(numbers).boxed(); // convert each num to Integer Consume the Stream IntStream.of(numbers).min(); // min IntStream.of(numbers).max(); // max IntStream.of(numbers).sum(); // sum IntStream.of(numbers).average(); // average IntStream.of(numbers).count(); // count  IntStream.range(1, 100).forEach(System.out::println); // print 1 to 99 IntStream.range(1, 100).toArray(); // collect into array IntStream.range(1, 100).boxed().collect(Collectors.toList()); // collect into list  IntStream.of(numbers).anyMatch(n -\u0026gt; n%2==1); // is any num odd IntStream.of(numbers).allMatch(n -\u0026gt; n%2==1); // are all num odd  Array.stream()  Similar to IntStream, we can create a stream from an array using Array.stream() and apply similar operations\nint[] intArray = new int[]{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 3, 5, 99}; int min = Arrays.stream(nums).min().getAsInt(); int max = Arrays.stream(nums).max().getAsInt(); double avg = Arrays.stream(nums).average().getAsDouble(); long count = Arrays.stream(nums).count(); long sum = Arrays.stream(nums).sum(); Arrays.stream(intArray) .distinct() .forEach(System.out::println); ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/java/streams-in-java-8/","tags":["Java Streams"],"title":"Streams in Java 8"},{"categories":["Java"],"contents":"Decorator design pattern is used to add a new feature on the existing object by wrapping it with a decorator class.\nIn this example, we will first create an interface Window interface and its implementation BasicWindow\ninterface Window { public String draw(); } class BasicWindow implements Window { @Override public String draw() { return \u0026#34;Basic Window\u0026#34;; } } Next, we want to decorate this Window with some border and scroll bar.

We set the brand and isTopModel values whereas value of color will be inherited. When we call drive() method, it finds the drive() in the prototype chain on car and execute.\nObject.assign() Object.assign() is used to copy the properties and functions of one object in another object.\nWe can merge two objects using Object.assign() as follows:-\n// Initialize an object const favorites = { color: \u0026#39;Red\u0026#39;, number: 5 }; // Initialize another object const somemore = { fruit: \u0026#39;Mango\u0026#39;, movies: [\u0026#34;Spider Man\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Conjuring\u0026#34;], }; // Merge the objects console.log(Object.assign(favorites, somemore)); Output {color: \u0026quot;Red\u0026quot;, number: 5, fruit: \u0026quot;Mango\u0026quot;, movies: [\u0026quot;Spider Man\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Conjuring\u0026quot;]} Also can be used in Class constructor to assign all values to this as follows:\nclass Car { constructor(brand, color, price){ Object.assign(this, {brand, color, price}); } } Object.freeze() Object.freeze() freezes the state of an Object once this method is called. It ignores if any existing property is modified, and if any new property is added.\n// Initialize an object const user = { username: \u0026#39;admin\u0026#39;, password: \u0026#39;password@123\u0026#39; }; // Freeze the object Object.freeze(user); user.password = \u0026#39;*******\u0026#39;; user.active = true; console.log(user); Output {username: \u0026quot;admin\u0026quot;, password: \u0026quot;password@123\u0026quot;} Object.seal() Object.seal() seals the state of an Object once this method is called. It allows the modification of existing properties, but ignores if any new property is added.\n// Initialize an object const user = { name: \u0026#39;admin\u0026#39;, password: \u0026#39;password@123\u0026#39; }; // Seal the object Object.seal(user); user.password = \u0026#39;*******\u0026#39;; user.active = true; console.log(user); Output {name: \u0026quot;admin\u0026quot;, password: \u0026quot;*******\u0026quot;} Object.defineProperty() Object.defineProperty() is used to define new property in existing object.\nProperty can be defined with following options:\n value: defaults to undefined, if value of the property is not provided writable: deafults to false, if true means value of the property can be changed configurable: defaults to false, if true means property can be deleted enumerable: defaults to false, if true means property can be enumerated such as in a for..in loop  var user = {}; Object.defineProperty(user, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, { value: \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34; }); console.log(user); is equivalent to\nvar user = {}; Object.defineProperty(user, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, { value: \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;, writable: false, configurable: false, enumerable: false }); console.log(user); Output {name: \u0026quot;admin\u0026quot;} Object.defineProperties() Object.defineProperties() can be used to define multiple properites in existing object.\nvar user = {}; Object.defineProperties(user, { name: { value: \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;, writable: true, enumerable: true }, password: { value: \u0026#39;password@123\u0026#39;, writable: false, enumerable: false } }); console.log(user); Output {name: \u0026quot;admin\u0026quot;, password: \u0026quot;password@123\u0026quot;} Object.keys(), Object.values() \u0026amp; Object.entries() Object.keys(), Object.values() and Object.entries() can be used iterator from the object as follows:\nlet favorites = { color: \u0026#39;Red\u0026#39;, number: 5, vegan: true, movies: [\u0026#34;Spider Man\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Conjuring\u0026#34;] }; console.log(\u0026#34;keys\u0026#34;, Object.keys(favorites)); console.log(\u0026#34;values\u0026#34;, Object.values(favorites)); console.log(\u0026#34;entries\u0026#34;, Object.entries(favorites)); Output keys [\u0026quot;color\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;number\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;vegan\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;movies\u0026quot;] values [\u0026quot;Red\u0026quot;, 5, true, [\u0026quot;Spider Man\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Conjuring\u0026quot;]] entries [ [\u0026quot;color\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Red\u0026quot;], [\u0026quot;number\u0026quot;, 5], [\u0026quot;vegan\u0026quot;, true], [\u0026quot;movies\u0026quot;, [\u0026quot;Spider Man\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Conjuring\u0026quot;] ] Object.keys() and Object.entries() can be used to iterate through the keys and values of an object as follows:-\nObject.keys(favorites).forEach(key =\u0026gt; console.log(`${key}: ${favorites[key]}`)); Object.entries(favorites).forEach(entry =\u0026gt; console.log(`${entry[0]}: ${entry[1]}`)); Object.is() ES6 has introduced a new method Object.is() to compare two values, it works very much similar to strict comparison operator === and also avoid confusion of NaN comparisons and +0/-0 comparisons.

Global Scope When variables is defined outside a function and accessible everywhere. All var, let and const are global scope.\n2. Function Scope Variables defined using var are function-scoped because if it is defined inside function, their visibility is limited to the function, or nested function. When you try to use it outside of the function, you’ll get an error.\nfunction myFn() { var foo = \u0026#39;peekaboo!\u0026#39;; console.log(foo); // Prints \u0026#39;peekaboo!\u0026#39; } console.log(foo); // ReferenceError: foo is not defined 3.

This is because all three instances are treated as different variables since they have different scopes.\n\n3. \u0026ldquo;const\u0026rdquo; The keyword const is similar to let, it’s block-scoped, however, you can’t reassign the value to it.\nconst PI = 3.1415; PI = 5; // \u0026#34;TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

It will print undefined. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it is interpreted by the compiler in hoisting process,\nvar foo; foo = 1; function myFun(){ var foo; // var hoisted and initialized with undefined  console.log(foo); // undefined  foo = 2; } myFun(); Just like var, let declarations also hoisted to the top but unlike var which is initialized as undefined, the let variable is not initialized. So if you try to use a let variable before declaration, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a Reference Error. const variables are similar to let variables in terms of hoisting.\nconsole.log(foo); let foo = 1; Output ReferenceError: foo is not defined Can you guess what is output of below code snippet? let foo = 1; function myFun(){ console.log(foo); let foo = 2; } myFun(); Have you guessed foo = undefined?\nNo its not. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it is interpreted by the compiler in hoisting process,\nlet foo; foo = 1; function myFun(){ let foo; // let hoisted without initialization unlike var  console.log(foo); // ReferenceError: Cannot access \u0026#39;foo\u0026#39; before initialization  foo = 2; } myFun(); Summary  So just in case, you missed the differences, here they are :\n    Scope Value Update Redefine Variable Hoisting     var function scope yes yes (within scope) initialized with undefined   let block scope yes no (within block scope) but yes (outside block scope) variable not initialized   const block scope no no variable not initialized     var variables are function scoped whereas let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized. While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.

I have tried to explain this problem as easy as possible.\nProblem Statement There is a building of 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor (say Nth floor) an egg can be dropped from without breaking.\n If an egg is dropped from that floor (N) or above (N+1, N+2, \u0026hellip;), it will break. If it is dropped from any floor below (N-1, N-2, \u0026hellip;), it will not break and you can drop the egg again.  Given two eggs 🥚🥚, find the floor (N) an egg can be dropped from without breaking in minimum number of drops.\n The question is, What strategy should you adopt to minimize the number egg drops it takes to find the solution?. (And what is the worst case for the number of drops it will take?)\nThink about the problem for a few minutes, and then read on.\nSolution 1 (Liner Search) First solution is linear search strategy which is very straightforward if we don\u0026rsquo;t care about number of drops. We can start dropping egg from floor 1, floor 2, floor 3 and continue till floor 100 until we find the floor N. In worst case it will take 100 drops if egg breaks only at the last (100th) floor.\n Linear search - worst case - 100 drops  Can we improve worst case using binary search strategy? Lets see in Solution 2.\nSolution 2 (Binary Search) Second solution is binary search strategy where we start from the middle (50th) floor.\n If egg breaks on 50th floor that means our N is below 50. If egg doesn\u0026rsquo;t break that means our N is above 50.  Binary search strategy say that If egg breaks on 50th floor then we should check now from 25th floor but wait, we have a problem here. We have already lost 1 egg and left with only 1 egg now so we are left with linear search only but in this case only from 1st to 50th floor in worst case. So our drops came down to half compare to solution 1\n Binary Search - worst case - 50 drops  Can we still improve the worst case? Let see in Solution 3\nSolution 3 (Divide and Conquer) Let\u0026rsquo;s apply our learning from previous solutions and apply a mix of linear and binary approach.\nThis time we start off by dropping an egg at floor 10, floor 20, floor 30 \u0026hellip;increasing floor by 10\n  If first egg breaks at floor 10, then we use second egg to linear search from 1 to 9\n  If first egg breaks at floor 20, then we use second egg to linear search from 11 to 19\n  \u0026hellip;.\n  In worst case if egg breaks at last (100th) floor then we use second egg to linear search from 91 to 99. In worst case it will take 19 drops (10th, 20th, 30th \u0026hellip;\u0026hellip; 70th 80th 90th 91th \u0026hellip;.99th)\n Divide and Conquer - worst case - 19 drops    Now when we came to an understanding, lets see Solution 4\nSolution 4 (Equation) What we need is a solution that minimizes our maximum drops. The solution above hint towards what we need is a strategy that tries to make solutions to all possible answers the same depth (same number of drops). The way to reduce the worst case is to attempt to make all cases take the same number of drops.\nAs I hope you can see by now, if the solution lays somewhere in a floor low down, then we have extra-headroom when we need to step by singles, but, as we get higher up the building, we’ve already used drop chances to get there, so there we have less drops left when we have to switch to going floor-by-floor.\nLet’s break out some algebra.\nImagine we drop our first egg from floor n, if it breaks, we can step through the previous (n-1) floors one-by-one.\nIf it doesn’t break, rather than jumping up another n floors, instead we should step up just (n-1) floors (because we have one less drop available if we have to switch to one-by-one floors), so the next floor we should try is floor n + (n-1)\nSimilarly, if this drop does not break, we next need to jump up to floor n + (n-1) + (n-2), then floor n + (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) …\nWe keep reducing the step by one each time we jump up, until that step-up is just one floor, and get the following equation for a 100 floor building:\nn + (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + (n-4) + … + 1 \u0026gt;= 100\nThis summation, as many will recognize, is the formula for triangular numbers (which kind of makes sense, since we’re reducing the step by one each drop we make) and can be simplified to:\nn (n+1) / 2 \u0026gt;= 100\nThis is a quadratic equation, with the positive root of 13.651 (Which we have to round up to 14)\nThis means we want to start dropping from floor 14, jump up 13 floors to drop from floor 27, jump up 12 floors to drop from floor 39, and so on. Our worst case scenario is then a drop count total of 14.\n Equation - worst case - 14 drops     Drop Floor     #1 14   #2 27   #3 39   #4 60   #6 69   #7 77   #8 84   #9 90   #10 95   #11 99   #12 100   ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/puzzle/2-eggs-and-100-floors/","tags":["Interview Puzzle","Google Interview Puzzle"],"title":"2 Eggs and 100 Floors Problem (Solved)"},{"categories":["Puzzles"],"contents":"The 25 Horses 5 Tracks Problem is a famous Google interview question that has been asked in many companies to evaluate candidate\u0026rsquo;s analytical ability and problem solving approach.\nProblem Statement You have 25 horses\n🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎\n🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎\n🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎\n🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎\n🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎\nand you need to identify the fastest 3 horses 🐎🐎🐎 out of those 25. Only 5 horses can run in each race at the same time as there are only 5 tracks.\nWhat is the minimum number of races required to identify the fastest 3 horses without using a stopwatch or timer?\nSolution This is an interesting puzzle. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the limitations first.\n We don’t have a stopwatch or timer so we can’t record the finish time of each horse otherwise we could have find out the fastest 3 horses by 5 races of 5 horse in each race. Only 5 horses can run in each race otherwise we could have find out fastest 3 horses by just one race of 25 horses.\n  First 5 Races So at this point we are certain that we need minimum 5 races first\n25 horses / 5 horses per race = 5 races  Visualization is very important for such puzzles.

Result of first five races are as follows:-\n   (Race 1) R1H5 R1H4 R1H3 R1H2 R1H1     (Race 2) R2H5 R2H4 R2H3 R2H2 R2H1   (Race 3) R3H5 R3H4 R3H3 R3H2 R3H1   (Race 4) R4H5 R4H4 R4H3 R4H2 R4H1   (Race 5) R5H5 R5H4 R5H3 R5H2 R5H1   Assume Results are as follows:- (Slowest) (Second Last) (Third Winner) (Second Winner) (Winner)    For simplicity let\u0026rsquo;s assume first horse of each race is winner i.e. R1H1, R2H1, R3H1, R4H4, R5H5.\n\n6th Race (The Race of winners of first 5 races) Now we need 6th race of all the winners of first 5 races i.e. R1H1, R2H1, R3H1, R4H4, R5H5. This race will reveal the fastest horse out of all 25 horses. Result of 6th race is as follows:-\n   (Race 6) R5H1 R4H1 R3H1 R2H1 R1H1     Assume Results are as follows:- (Slowest) (Second Last) (Third Winner) (Second Winner) (Winner)    For simplicity let\u0026rsquo;s assume first horse of first race i.e. R1H1 is winner for 6th race.\n (6th Race) Race of winners of first 5 races\n  Now we know the fastest horse R1H1 out of all 25 horses but we don\u0026rsquo;t know the 2nd and 3rd fastest horse yet because 2nd and 3rd might be from 1st race since R1H1 from Race 1 is the fastest horse OR from the winners of all first five races.\n\n7th Race (The Race of Chosen Five) To understand this we need to align all the horses as per their ranking in each race and eliminate the horses which are definitely cannot be 2nd and 3rd fastest\n   (Race 1) R1H5 R1H4 R1H3 R1H2 R1H1     (Race 2) R2H5 R2H4 R2H3 R2H2 R2H1   (Race 3) R3H5 R3H4 R3H3 R3H2 R3H1   (Race 4) R4H5 R4H4 R4H3 R4H2 R4H1   (Race 5) R5H5 R5H4 R5H3 R5H2 R5H1   Assume Results are as follows:- (Slowest) (Second Last) (Third Winner) (Second Winner) (Winner)     Race 1: Since fastest horse R1H1 is from Race 1, second R1H2 and third R1H3 winner of Race 1 can be 2nd and 3rd faster so eliminate Second Last and Slowest. Also eliminate the fastest horse because that can not be 2nd or 3rd fastest. We already know that. Race 2: Second winner of 6th race R2H1 is from Race 2 so it can be 2nd fastest horse. If it is 2nd fastest then second winner R2H2 can be 3rd fastest. Eliminate rest. Race 3: Third winner of 6th race R3H1 is from Race 3 so it can ve 3rd fastest horse. Eliminate rest. Race 4: Fourth winner of 6th race is from from Race 4. Since we have to find 2nd and 3rd fastest horse. Eliminate all. Race 5: Fifth winner of 6th race is from from Race 5. Since we have to find 2nd and 3rd fastest horse. Eliminate all.  Now that we’ve eliminated the all of the horses that can’t possibly be in the top three, what are we left with? The chosen 5 horses, let\u0026rsquo;s do the 7th race:-\n (7th Race) Race of the chosen 5\n  The first and second winner of the 7th race will be the 2nd and 3rd fastest horse out of all 25 horses. So you need minimum 7 races to identify fastest 3 horses.\n5 races (of all 25) + 6th race (winners of first 5 races) + 7th race (the chosen five) = 7 races\nConclusion I have tried to explain the solution as easy as possible.

In each house lives a man of different nationality These five homeowners each drink a different kind of beverage, smoke different brand of cigar and keep a different pet.  The question is \u0026ldquo;Who owns the fish?\u0026quot;\nClues:\n The British man lives in a red house. The Swedish man keeps dogs as pets. The Danish man drinks tea. The Green house is next to, and on the left of the White house. The owner of the Green house drinks coffee. The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds. The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill. The man living in the center house drinks milk. The Norwegian lives in the first house. The man who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats. The man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill. The man who smokes Blue Master drinks beer. The German smokes Prince. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house. The Blends smoker lives next to the one who drinks water.  Solution It\u0026rsquo;s the German.\nHow do you solve it?\nWell, we know from examining the clues and the question that:\nThe possible nationalities are: Norwegian British Swedish Danish German\nThe possible house colors are: Red Green White Yellow Blue\nThe possible beverages are: Tea Coffee Milk Beer Water\nThe possible cigars are: Pall Mall Dunhill Blends BlueMaster Prince\nThe possible pets are: Dogs Birds Cats Horses Fish\nWell, we know there are five houses. We\u0026rsquo;ll assume they\u0026rsquo;re all in a row, and are numbered from left to right. We know the Norwegian is in the first house:\n   House #1 #2 #3 #4 #5     Color ? ? ? ? ?   Nationality Norwegian ? ? ? ?   Beverage ? ? ? ? ?   Smokes ? ? ? ? ?   Pet ? ? ? ? ?    Since the British lives in the red house, the Norwegian can\u0026rsquo;t. We also know the Norwegian lives next to the blue house, so his house isn\u0026rsquo;t blue. We also know that the green house is to the left of the white house; the Norwegian can\u0026rsquo;t live in the white house since there is no house to the left, and can\u0026rsquo;t live in the green house because his only neighbor, the one to the right, is known to live in the blue house. Therefore, the Norwegian lives in the yellow house.\nWe also know the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill, and that the Norwegian has a neighbor with a blue house (the Norwegian only has one neighbor, to the right.)\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s what our matrix looks like now:\n   House #1 #2 #3 #4 #5     Color Yellow Blue ? ? ?   Nationality Norwegian ? ? ? ?   Beverage ? ? ? ? ?   Smokes Dunhill ? ? ? ?   Pet ? ? ? ? ?    The man who keeps horses lives next to he man who smokes Dunhill; so the horse owner lives in the blue house. The center house\u0026rsquo;s owner drinks milk, the green house\u0026rsquo;s owner drinks coffee, and the green house is to the left of the white house. Since we know the left two houses are the yellow and blue houses, the only position for the green and white are green as the fourth and white as the fifth, since the middle (third) drinks milk and the owner of the green house drinks coffee. The middle house has to be red, and therefore is the Brit\u0026rsquo;s. So now this is what we know:\n   House #1 #2 #3 #4 #5     Color Yellow Blue Red Green White   Nationality Norwegian ? British ? ?   Beverage ? ? Milk Coffee ?   Smokes Dunhill ? ? ? ?   Pet ? Horse ? ? ?    The owner who smokes BlueMaster drinks beer; since we know what houses #3 and #4 drink [and neither are beer] and we know what house #1 smokes [and its not BlueMaster], the only possibilities are houses #2 and #5. Keep this information in mind. Since it is evident house #1 cannot drink beer (only house #2 or #5 can), the only possible beverages for house #1 are water and tea, but since the Dane drinks tea, house #1 drinks water. The man who smokes Blends lives next to someone who drinks water; the only house next to #1 (the water-drinking house) is #2. The man who smokes Blends lives next to the one who has cats; so the cat-house is #1 or #3.\n   House #1 #2 #3 #4 #5     Color Yellow Blue Red Green White   Nationality Norwegian ? British ? ?

The only houses that could drink beer are #2 and #5, but since we know that #2 smokes Blends, #5 must be the house which drinks beer and smokes BlueMaster, and #2 has to be the house that drinks tea and the house of the Dane. We can eliminate the possibility of the Dane\u0026rsquo;s residence being house #5.\n   House #1 #2 #3 #4 #5     Color Yellow Blue Red Green White   Nationality Norwegian Danish British S/G? S/G?

But there are other solutions too.\n√4 + √4 + √4 = 6 (4 – 4/4)! = 6 (√4 + 4/4)! = 6  Now we just have a couple more to solve and we will use 3! = 6 in many of the answers. We can solve for 10 as:\n(√(10 – 10/10))! = 6  Then we have the 1 solution:\n(1 + 1 + 1)! = 6  To solve 0, we use the fact that 0! = 1, and then we have reduced the problem to solving 1 1 1 = 6, which was previously solved.\n(0! + 0! + 0!)! = 6  We just have one more to solve, which many people consider to be the hardest. One way to solve uses nested square roots.\n8 – √(√(8 + 8)) = 6  The other method uses 3! = 6.\n(√(8 + 8/8))! = 6  And we are done! Here are the above solutions listed in numerical order. This is not a comprehensive list. you might have found another way too!\n(0! + 0! + 0!)! = 6 (1 + 1 + 1)! = 6 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 3 × 3 – 3 = 6 3! + 3 – 3 = 6 3! × (3/3) = 6 √(3 × 3) + 3 = 6 √4 + √4 + √4 = 6 (4 – 4/4)! = 6 (√4 + 4/4)! = 6 5 + 5/5 = 6 6 + 6 – 6 = 6 6 ×(6/6) = 6 7 – 7/7 = 6 8 – √(√(8 + 8)) = 6 (√(8 + 8/8))! = 6 √9 × √9 – √9 = 6 (√9)! + √9 – √9 = 6 (√9)! × √9/√9 = 6 (√9 × √9/√9)! = 6 (√(10 – 10/10))! = 6 ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/puzzle/the-6s-math-puzzle/","tags":["Maths Puzzle"],"title":"The 6s Math Puzzle"},{"categories":["Spring Boot"],"contents":"Swagger library is useful if you are creating REST services in spring boot web application. Swagger user interface allows you to view REST services and execute GET, POST, PUT, DELETE HTTP endpoints.

We\u0026rsquo;re using application.yml to define properties. You may also use application.properties file.\napplication.yml app: name: spring boot application api: title: Spring Boot APIs version: 1.0.0 description: Spring Boot APIs description base-package: com.abc.controller contact-name: apisupportgroup contact-email: apisupportgroup@abc.com swagger: enable: true Note that we\u0026rsquo;ve added a property app.api.swagger.enable to enable or disable swagger from our Sprint boot project.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s use all these properties and define our SwaggerConfig class file.\nDefine SwaggerConfig.java Let\u0026rsquo;s create SwaggerConfig class to configure Swagger in our Spring boot project.\n1@Configuration 2@EnableSwagger2 3@ConfigurationProperties(\u0026#34;app.api\u0026#34;) 4@ConditionalOnProperty(name=\u0026#34;app.api.swagger.enable\u0026#34;, havingValue = \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;, matchIfMissing = false) 5public class SwaggerConfig { 6 7\tprivate String version; 8\tprivate String title; 9\tprivate String description; 10\tprivate String basePackage; 11\tprivate String contactName; 12\tprivate String contactEmail; 13\t14\t@Bean 15\tpublic Docket api() { 16\treturn new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2) 17\t.select() 18\t.apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage(basePackage)) 19\t.paths(PathSelectors.any()) 20\t.build() 21\t.directModelSubstitute(LocalDate.class, java.sql.Date.class) 22\t.directModelSubstitute(LocalDateTime.class, java.util.Date.class) 23\t.apiInfo(apiInfo()); 24\t} 25\t26\tprivate ApiInfo apiInfo() { 27\treturn new ApiInfoBuilder() 28\t.title(title) 29\t.description(description) 30\t.version(version) 31\t.contact(new Contact(contactName, null, contactEmail)) 32\t.build(); 33\t} 34 35\t/** 36... 37... 38Getters 39Setters 40... 41... 42**/ 43} Note some important points of our SwaggerConfig class file:\n @Configuration annotation is used to auto scan this class file. @EnableSwagger2 annotation is used to help Spring boot project to add necessary dependency for Swagger @ConfigurationProperties annotation is used to read properties from application.yml and initialize fields @ConditionalOnProperty annotation is used to initialize SwaggerConfig bean based on app.api.swagger.enable property flag. Line 21, 22 is correct way in swagger to map \u0026ldquo;Date\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;DateTime\u0026rdquo; to their corresponding swagger types:  Substitute \u0026ldquo;Date\u0026rdquo; types (java.util.LocalDate, org.joda.time.LocalDate) by java.sql.Date.

Now define some controllers to expose REST api endpoints and start your spring boot application. You will be able to see swagger UI something like this:-\nURL for Swagger API User Interface\nhttp://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html URL for Swagger API Docs Json\nhttp://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs Turn off Swagger in Production Swagger user interface is very convenient for development purpose.

The most common scenario to do so is when an endpoint is not ready yet. Also, we could have some private endpoints which we don\u0026rsquo;t want to expose.\nWe can hide such endpoints from Swagger Docs by annotating controller class or its method with @ApiIgnore annotation.\nHide Specific Endpoint If you want to hide specific endpoint of a controller class, apply the @ApiIgnore annotation at method level.\n@RestController public class UserController { @ApiIgnore @GetMapping(\u0026#34;/getUser\u0026#34;) public String getUser() { return \u0026#34;Ashish Lahoti\u0026#34;; } } Hide All Endpoints If you want to hide all endpoints of a controller class, apply the @ApiIgnore annotation at class level.\n@ApiIgnore @RestController public class UserController { // regular code } Generate REST Client with Swagger Codegen Swagger provides a swagger-codegen-cli utility jar that allows us to generate REST clients for various programming languages and multiple frameworks.\nDownload Jar file Download the latest swagger-codegen-cli.jar from here\nGenerate REST Client Let\u0026rsquo;s generate our REST client by executing the command from command-line:\njava -jar swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate \\ -i http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs \\ --api-package com.example.client.api \\ --model-package com.example.client.model \\ --invoker-package com.example.client.invoker \\ --group-id com.example \\ --artifact-id spring-swagger-codegen-api-client \\ --artifact-version 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT \\ -l java \\ -o spring-swagger-codegen-api-client The provided arguments consist of:\n -i is source swagger file URL or path –api-package, –model-package, –invoker-package are package names for generated classes –group-id, –artifact-id, –artifact-version are Maven project properties for generated client project -l is the programming language of the generated client -o is the output directory name  To list all Java-related options, type the following command:\njava -jar swagger-codegen-cli.jar config-help -l java \n Download the complete source code from github\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/spring-boot/how-to-configure-swagger/","tags":["Spring Boot REST"],"title":"How to configure Swagger in spring boot"},{"categories":["Spring Boot"],"contents":"Spring boot application comes with default banner which shows up first when you start your application.\n . ____ _ __ _ _ /\\\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __ __ _ \\ \\ \\ \\ ( ( )\\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \\/ _` | \\ \\ \\ \\ \\\\/ ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| | ) ) ) ) ' |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\\__, | / / / / =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/ :: Spring Boot :: (v2.1.3.RELEASE) You can replace above banner with your self made custom banner in following two easy steps:-\n Also see how to disable spring boot default banner\n 1.

Spring Boot has become a trending topic to be asked in interviews from Java backend developers in 2021.\nI have spent quite some time to prepare a very comprehensive list of questions and answers being asked in spring boot interviews. I hope, this will benefit both freshers as well as experienced developers in their interview preparation.\nQ1. What is Spring Boot and why we need this? Spring framework has become complicated over the years with lot of features. Initial Spring project setup takes time due to following :-\n Include all required spring modules and related thirdparty libraries Take care of version compatibility of spring module with other thirdparty jars Understanding of writing spring context xml Setup tomcat and web.xml for web application deployment Build process to generate jar/war and deployment process Best practices to use spring modules  ✰ Spring boot solves all this problems and help to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based applications that you can just run.\nSpring Boot take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.\nFeatures  Create stand-alone Spring applications Embedded server (like Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow) to avoid complexity in application (WAR files) deployment Provide opinionated \u0026lsquo;starter\u0026rsquo; dependencies to simplify your build and application configuration Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration\n  Q2. What @SpringBootApplication annotation do? @SpringBootApplication comprises of three annotations which are widely used:-\n @EnableAutoConfiguration enable Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism @ComponentScan enable @Component scan on the package where the application is located @Configuration allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes\n  Q3. What happens in the background when a spring boot application runs?  Looks for active profile and initialize properties and beans based on profile Automatically launch an embedded tomcat server if it is a web application means project has spring-boot-starter-web dependency in pom.xml  \nQ4. What is Spring Initializer? We can quickly generate spring boot project by choosing language (Java, Kotlin, Groovy), builder (Maven,, Gradle), spring boot version, project metadata (group, artifact, name, description, package name, java version) and spring boot dependencies (spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-jpa etc.) using Spring Initializer\nQ5. What is spring-boot-starter-parent? The spring-boot-starter-parent is spring boot starter project. It can be used as a parent in our project\u0026rsquo;s pom.xml:\n\u0026lt;parent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-parent\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;2.2.6.RELEASE\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/parent\u0026gt; parent project provide following things:-\n Default Java compiler version UTF-8 source encoding Dependency management inherited from spring-boot-dependencies POM which allow us to omit version tag for common dependencies. Resource filtering only import required thirdparty libraries based on application.properties or application.yml Default configuration for maven plugins such as maven-failsafe-plugin, maven-jar-plugin, maven-surefire-plugin, maven-war-plugin.\n  Q6. What is default embedded server and port in spring boot? How to change server port? Spring boot provides support for Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow embedded servers. Default embedded server is Tomcat and default port is 8080.\nDefault server port can be changed using server.port property or command line argument -Dserver.port.\n Also read different ways to change server port in spring boot\n You can always change the default server Tomcat to another embedded server such as Jetty or Undertow by:-\n excluding the dependency of tomcat spring-boot-starter-tomcat from spring-boot-starter-web and, adding the dependency of other server like jetty spring-boot-starter-jetty.  \u0026lt;!-- Exclude Spring Boot\u0026#39;s Default Tomcat Server --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-web\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;exclusions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;exclusion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-tomcat\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/exclusion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/exclusions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Add Jetty Server Dependency --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-jetty\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; \nQ7. What is default logging in Sprint Boot? How to change default logging? Spring boot provides logback as default logging.\nIf you want to change default logging to log4j2 then:-\n exclude spring-boot-starter-logging from spring-boot-starter and, add spring-boot-starter-log4j2 dependency  \u0026lt;!-- Exclude Spring Boot\u0026#39;s Default Logback Logging --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;exclusions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;exclusion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-logging\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/exclusion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/exclusions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Add Log4j2 Dependency --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-log4j2\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; \nQ8. How to generate deployable JAR and WAR file in Spring Boot? Spring boot provides a maven plugin spring-boot-maven-plugin to generate JAR and WAR files which we can add in pom.xml as follows:\n\u0026lt;plugin\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/plugin\u0026gt; JAR When this plugin is in place, we get a fat executable JAR after executing maven package phase. This JAR contains all the necessary dependencies, including an embedded server. Thus, we do not need to worry about configuring an external server.\nWAR When we want to generate a WAR file, we change packaging to war and change scope of embedded server as provided in pom.xml\n\u0026lt;!-- Set packaging to war, default value is jar if not provided --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;packaging\u0026gt;war\u0026lt;/packaging\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Change the scope of embedded server as provided, so that WAR doesn\u0026#39;t contain embedded server in its package --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-tomcat\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;scope\u0026gt;provided\u0026lt;/scope\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; \nQ9. How to configure properties in Spring Boot? Spring Boot provides support for external configuration, allowing us to run the same application in various environments. We can use properties files, YAML files, environment variables, system properties, and command-line option arguments to specify configuration properties.\nWe can then gain access to those properties using the @Value annotation, a bound object via the @ConfigurationProperties annotation, or the Environment abstraction.\nHere are the most common sources of external configuration:\n Command-line properties: Command-line option arguments are program arguments starting with a double hyphen, such as –-server.port=8080. Spring Boot converts all the arguments to properties and adds them to the set of environment properties. Application properties: Application properties are those loaded from the application.properties file or its YAML counterpart. By default, Spring Boot searches for this file in the current directory, classpath root, or their config subdirectory. Profile-specific properties: Profile-specific properties are loaded from the application-{profile}.properties file or its YAML counterpart. The {profile} placeholder refers to an active profile. These files are in the same locations as, and take precedence over, non-specific property files.\n  Q10. What is Spring Boot Actuator? Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features for monitoring and managing spring boot application by exposing many useful HTTP endpoints related to application health, info etc.\nTo Enable Actuator in spring boot application, we just need to include spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency in the pom.xml file:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-starter-actuator\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Some of the most common built-in endpoints Actuator provides:\n info: Displays arbitrary application information health: Shows application health information auditevents: Exposes audit events information env: Exposes environment properties httptrace: Displays HTTP trace information metrics: Shows metrics information loggers: Shows and modifies the configuration of loggers in the application mappings: Displays a list of all @RequestMapping paths scheduledtasks: Displays the scheduled tasks in your application threaddump: Performs a thread dump\n  Q11. What is Spring Boot Devtools? Spring Boot DevTools, is a set of tools making the development process easier. To Enable DevTools in spring boot application, we just need to add a dependency to the pom.xml file:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-devtools\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; The spring-boot-devtools module is automatically disabled if the application runs in production. The repackaging of archives also excludes this module by default. Hence, it won\u0026rsquo;t bring any overhead to our final product.\nBy default, DevTools applies properties suitable to a development environment. These properties disable template caching, enable debug logging for the web group, and so on. As a result, we have this sensible development-time configuration without setting any properties.\nApplications using DevTools restart whenever a file on the classpath changes. This is a very helpful feature in development, as it gives quick feedback for modifications.\nBy default, static resources, including view templates, don\u0026rsquo;t set off a restart. Instead, a resource change triggers a browser refresh. Notice this can only happen if the LiveReload extension is installed in the browser to interact with the embedded LiveReload server that DevTools contains.\nQ12. What does it mean that Spring Boot supports relaxed binding? Relaxed binding in Spring Boot is applicable to the type-safe binding of configuration properties.\nWith relaxed binding, the key of an environment property doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be an exact match of a property name. Such an environment property can be written in camelCase, kebab-case, snake_case, or in uppercase with words separated by underscores.\nFor example, if a property in a bean class with the @ConfigurationProperties annotation is named myProp, it can be bound to any of these environment properties: myProp, my-prop, my_prop, or MY_PROP.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/top-spring-boot-interview-questions/","tags":["Interview Q\u0026A","Spring Q\u0026A"],"title":"Top Spring Boot Interview Questions"},{"categories":["Interview Questions"],"contents":"Spring Framework is widely used by Java developers for enterprise application development and most frequent topic to be asked in interviews from Java backend developers in 2021.\nI have spent quite some time to prepare a very comprehensive list of questions and answers being asked in spring framework interview. I hope, this will benefit both freshers as well as experienced developers in their interview preparation.\nQ1. What is Spring Framework? The Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.\nThe Spring Framework is most widely used framework across the globe which provides the best practices to use design patterns such as Singleton, Prototype, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Decorator, Service Locator, and many more out of the box.\nQ2. What are the Benefits of using Spring Framework? Spring framework targets to make Java EE development easier. Here are the advantages of using it:\n Lightweight: there is a slight overhead of using the framework in development Inversion of Control (IoC): Spring container takes care of wiring dependencies of various objects, instead of creating or looking for dependent objects Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP): Spring supports AOP to separate business logic from system services IoC container: it manages Spring Bean life cycle and project specific configurations MVC framework: that is used to create web applications or RESTful web services, capable of returning XML/JSON responses Transaction management: reduces the amount of boiler-plate code in JDBC operations, file uploading, etc., either by using Java annotations or by Spring Bean XML configuration file Exception Handling: Spring provides a convenient API for translating technology-specific exceptions into unchecked exceptions\n  Q3. What are the Modules available in Spring Framework?  Spring Framework Overview\n  1. Core Container  spring-bean and spring-core modules provide the fundamental parts of the framework, including the IoC and Dependency Injection features. spring-context module builds on the solid base provided by the Core and Beans modules. It provides a way to access java object as beans and manage their life-cycle. It also supports internationalization and Java EE features such as EJB, JMX, and basic remoting. spring-expression module provides a powerful Expression Language for querying and manipulating an object graph at runtime. It is an extension of the unified expression language (unified EL) as specified in the JSP 2.1 specification. The language supports setting and getting property values, property assignment, method invocation, accessing the content of arrays, collections and indexers, logical and arithmetic operators, named variables, and retrieval of objects by name from Spring’s IoC container.  2. AOP and Instrumentation  spring-aop module is used to decouple code for cross-cutting concerns such as logging by using method-interceptors and pointcuts. spring-aspect module provide integration with AspectJ spring-instrument module provides class instrumentation support and classloader implementations to be used in certain application servers. spring-instrument-tomcat module contains Spring’s instrumentation agent for Tomcat.  3. Data Access/Integration  spring-jdbc module provides a JDBC-abstraction layer that removes the need to do tedious JDBC coding and parsing of database-vendor specific error codes. spring-tx module supports programmatic and declarative transaction management for classes that implement special interfaces and for all your POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects). spring-orm module provides integration layers for popular object-relational mapping APIs, including JPA and Hibernate. Using the spring-orm module you can use these O/R-mapping frameworks in combination with all of the other features Spring offers, such as the simple declarative transaction management feature mentioned previously. spring-oxm module provides an abstraction layer that supports Object/XML mapping implementations such as JAXB, Castor, JiBX and XStream. spring-jms module (Java Messaging Service) contains features for producing and consuming messages.  4. Web  spring-web module provides basic web-oriented integration features such as multipart file upload functionality and the initialization of the IoC container using Servlet listeners and a web-oriented application context. It also contains an HTTP client and the web-related parts of Spring’s remoting support. spring-webmvc module (also known as the Web-Servlet module) contains Spring’s model-view-controller (MVC) and REST Web Services implementation for web applications. Spring’s MVC framework provides a clean separation between domain model code and web forms and integrates with all of the other features of the Spring Framework. spring-websocket module provides WebSocket and SockJS infrastructure, including STOMP messaging support  5. Test  spring-test module supports the unit testing and integration testing of Spring components with JUnit or TestNG. It provides consistent loading of Spring ApplicationContexts and caching of those contexts. It also provides mock objects that you can use to test your code in isolation.\n  Q4. Name Some of the Design Patterns used in the Spring Framework?  Singleton Pattern: Singleton-scoped beans (default scope of spring beans) Prototype Pattern: Prototype-scoped beans Factory Pattern: BeanFactory, ApplicationContext Adapter Pattern: Spring Web and Spring MVC Proxy Pattern: Spring Aspect Oriented Programming support Template Method Pattern: RestTemplate, JmsTemplate, JdbcTemplate, JpaTemplate, HibernateTemplate Front Controller: Spring MVC DispatcherServlet Data Access Object: Spring DAO support Model View Controller: Spring MVC\n  Q5. What is Inversion of Control?  Inversion of Control (IoC) is a programming principle which inverts the flow of control compare to traditional control flow.\n A Java application consists of objects which are dependent on each other and work together to run the application. In a traditional java application, JRE instantiate classes and dependent objects at compile time hance objects are tightly coupled with each other.\nHow we can use IoC in Java application context?\nWe can use various patterns such as Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder \u0026hellip; to instantiate classes and dependent objects at runtime instead of compile time. You see that we have inverted the control from compile time to runtime, which is IoC.\nHow Spring Framework IoC works?\nThe Spring Framework IoC container provides the implementation of Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, and many more patterns out of the box with best design practices used which you can integrate into your own application(s).\nQ6. What is Dependency Injection?  Dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on.\n Dependency Injection, is a form of IoC, is a general concept stating that you do not create your objects manually but instead describe how they should be created. An IoC container will instantiate required classes if needed.\nHow Spring Framework DI works?\nThe Spring Framework DI provides us the way to describe the object and its dependencies in the the form of XML or Java annotations. Spring IoC container takes care of wire them up together.\nQ7. What are different ways of Dependency Injection in Spring Framework? Spring framework provides three ways for dependency injection:-\n1. Constructor-Based Dependency Injection Spring use constructor to inject dependency. It is recommended to use for mandatory dependencies.\n@Configuration public class AppConfig { @Bean public Item item1() { return new ItemImpl1(); } @Bean public Store store() { return new Store(item1()); } } \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;item1\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.ItemImpl1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;store\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Store\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;constructor-arg type=\u0026#34;ItemImpl1\u0026#34; index=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34; ref=\u0026#34;item1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; 2. Setter-Based Dependency Injection Spring use setter method to inject dependency. It is recommended to use for optional dependencies.\n@Bean public Store store() { Store store = new Store(); store.setItem(item1()); return store; } \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;store\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Store\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34; ref=\u0026#34;item1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; 3. Field-Based Dependency Injection Spring looks for fields annotated with @Autowired and inject them using reflection.\npublic class Store { @Autowired private Item item; } \nQ8. Differentiate between Constructor and Setter Based Dependency Injection? Constructor vs Setter Based Dependency Injection  Partial dependency injection is possible in setter-based, say we have 3 dependencies int, string, boolean, if we inject first two, then third boolean will be initialized with default value. Since constructor-based injection call the constructor, we need to pass all the arguments, and so partial injection is not possible. In case of injecting the same dependency using both setter-based and constructor-based then setter-based injection override the constructor-based dependency injection. It\u0026rsquo;s obvious because constructor is called first before setter methods in bean life cycle. It is recommended to user constructor-based injection for mandatory dependencies as it fails if you do not pass all the required dependency, whereas, setter-based injection is recommended for optional dependencies as you can inject partial dependencies. If Object A and B are dependent on each other and you are trying constructor-based injection then Spring throws ObjectCurrentlyInCreationException while instantiating Objects because A object cannot be initialized until B is ready and vice-versa. This circular dependency issue can be solved using setter-based injection.\n  Q9. How many types of IOC Containers are there in Spring Framework?   BeanFactory is an interface representing a container that provides and manages bean instances. The default implementation instantiates beans lazily when getBean() is called.\n  ApplicationContext is an interface representing a container holding all information, metadata, and beans in the application. It is built on top of BeanFactory interface but the default implementation instantiates beans eagerly when the application starts. This behavior can be overridden for individual beans.\nThree most commonly used implementation of ApplicationContext are:-\n ClassPathXmlApplicationContext loads the XML configuration file from the classpath ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(“bean.xml”);  FileSystemXmlApplicationContext loads the XML configuration file from the file system ApplicationContext context = new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext(“bean.xml”);  XmlWebApplicationContext loads the XML configuration file from the /WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml location by default\n    Q10. Differentiate between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext? BeanFactory vs ApplicationContext    BeanFactory ApplicationContext     It is an interface defined in org.springframework .beans.factory package It is an interface defined in org.springframework .context package   It uses Lazy initialization It uses Eager initialization by default   It explicitly provides a resource object using the syntax It creates and manages resource objects on its own   It doesn’t supports internationalization It supports internationalization   It doesn’t supports annotation based dependency It supports annotation based dependency    \nQ11. What is a Spring Bean? The Spring Beans are Java Objects that are instantiated, configured, wired, and managed by the Spring IoC container. Spring Bean definition and metadata is provided by XML configuration or Java annotations, which is used by Spring IoC container. Q12. Explain the Spring Bean Life Cycle?  Spring Bean Life Cycle\n  Spring bean follow the following sequence in its life cycle:-\n Default constructor will be called. All properties setter methods will be called. If class implements BeanNameAware then setBeanName method will be called. If class implements BeanFactoryAware then setBeanFactory method will be called. If class implements ApplicationContextAware then setApplicationContext method will be called. If class implements BeanPostProcessor then its postProcessBeforeInitialization will be called. If class implements InitializingBean then afterPropertiesSet method will be called. If class has custom init method defined then it will be called. If class implements BeanPostProcessor then its postProcessAfterInitialization will be called. If class implements DisposableBean then destroy method will be called. If class has custom destroy method defined then it will be called.  custom-init and custom-destroy example \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;store\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Store\u0026#34; init-method=\u0026#34;myCustomInit\u0026#34; destroy-method=\u0026#34;myCustomDestroy\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \nQ13. What are different ways to configure Spring Beans? There are three ways to define Beans configuration in Spring Framework:-\n XML-based Configuration Java-based configuration Annotation-based configuration\n  Q14. What is XML-based Spring Configuration? In XML-Based configuration, all the bean definitions and application specific configurations are defined in an XML file in a specific format. Parent XML element is \u0026lt;/beans\u0026gt; and individual bean is defined using \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; element.\n\u0026lt;!-- Spring Configurations --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean name=\u0026#34;viewResolver\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;org.springframework.web.servlet.view.BeanNameViewResolver\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean name=\u0026#34;jsonTemplate\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;org.springframework.web.servlet.view.json.MappingJackson2JsonView\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;restTemplate\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Bean Definition --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;tutorial\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.TutorialBean\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;CodingNConcepts\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; \nQ15. What is Java-based Spring Configuration? Spring configuration can also be defined using @Configuration annotated classes and @Bean annotated methods where,\n @Configuration annotated class represents an XML configuration file @Bean annotated methods represent the  element and responsible to provide a bean definition.  @Configuration public class AppConfig { @Bean public MyService myService() { return new MyServiceImpl(); } } is equivalent of following XML configuration\n\u0026lt;beans\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;myService\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.services.MyServiceImpl\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/beans\u0026gt; To instantiate such config, you will need the help of AnnotationConfigApplicationContext class.\npublic static void main(String[] args) { ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class); MyService myService = ctx.getBean(MyService.class); myService.doStuff(); } or alternatively you can enable component scanning, to instantiate config automatically.\n@Configuration @ComponentScan(basePackages = \u0026#34;com.abc\u0026#34;) public class AppConfig { ... } In the example above, the com.abc package will be scanned and look for @Component or other stereotypes annotated classes, and those classes will be instantiated and managed by as Spring container automatically.\nQ16. What is Annotation-based Spring Configuration? Annotation-based container configuration is an alternative of XML-based configuration and is mostly used by developers. Rather than using XML for describing a bean wiring, the developer moves the configuration to the classes by using annotations on the class, field, or method declaration.\nBy default, annotation config is turned off. It needs to be turned on explicitly by adding \u0026lt;context:annotation-config/\u0026gt; element in Spring Configuration XML file.\n\u0026lt;beans\u0026gt; \u0026lt;context:annotation-config/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- bean definitions go here --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/beans\u0026gt; Alternatively, you can include AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor in bean configuration file.\n\u0026lt;beans\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean class=\u0026#34;org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/beans\u0026gt; \nQ17. Can We Have Multiple Spring Configuration Files in One Project? Yes, in large projects, having multiple Spring configurations is recommended to increase maintainability and modularity.\nYou can load multiple Java-based configuration files:\n@Configuration @Import({MainConfig.class, SchedulerConfig.class}) public class AppConfig { Or load one XML file that will contain all other configs:\nApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\u0026#34;spring-all.xml\u0026#34;); And inside this XML file you\u0026rsquo;ll have:\n\u0026lt;import resource=\u0026#34;main.xml\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;import resource=\u0026#34;other.xml\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \nQ18. How to define Scope of a Spring Bean? Spring Bean\u0026rsquo;s scope can be defined either using @Scope annotation or scope attribute in XML configuration files. There are five supported scopes:\n\u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;mySingleton\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.MySingleton\u0026#34; scope=\u0026#34;singleton\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;   singleton: bean scope provides single instance per Spring IoC container. This means everytime spring application context returns same instance when we ask.\nPoints to remember about Singleton bean:-\nSingleton is the default bean scope\nSingleton beans are not thread safe\n  prototype: bean scope creates a new instance each and every time a bean is requested from spring container\n  request: bean scope creates a new instance on every incoming HTTP-request.\n  session: bean scope creates a new instance per HTTP-session.\n  global-session: bean scope creates a new instance per Global HTTP-session. It is useful for Portlet based applications where bean is used to store global info used by all portlets. This scope works same as session scope in Servlet based applications.\n  The last three are available only if the users use a web-aware ApplicationContext.\nQ19. What are inner beans in Spring? In Spring framework, whenever a bean is used for only one particular property, it is advised to declare it as an inner bean. The inner bean is supported both in setter injection property and constructor injection constructor-arg.\nFor example, let’s say we have Store class having reference of Item class. In our application, we will be creating only one instance of Item class, and use it inside Store.\npublic class Store { private Item item; //Setters and Getters } public class Item { private String name; private long quantity; //Setters and Getters } Now inner bean declaration will look like this:\n\u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;StoreBean\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Store\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;item\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- This is inner bean --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Item\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;Fruits\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;quantity\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;100\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; \nQ20. Are Singleton beans thread safe in Spring Framework? Spring framework does not do anything under the hood concerning the multi-threaded behavior of a singleton bean. It is the developer’s responsibility to deal with concurrency issue and thread safety of the singleton bean.\nWhile practically, most spring beans have no mutable state (e.g. Service and DAO clases), and as such are trivially thread safe. But if your bean has mutable state (e.g. View Model Objects), so you need to ensure thread safety. The most easy and obvious solution for this problem is to change bean scope of mutable beans from singleton to prototype.\nQ21. How can you inject a Java Collection in Spring? Give example? Spring offers four types of collection configuration elements which are as follows:\n \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; : This helps in wiring ie injecting a list of values, allowing duplicates. \u0026lt;set\u0026gt; : This helps in wiring a set of values but without any duplicates. \u0026lt;map\u0026gt; : This can be used to inject a collection of name-value pairs where name and value can be of any type. \u0026lt;props\u0026gt; : This can be used to inject a collection of name-value pairs where the name and value are both Strings.  Let’s see example of each type.\n\u0026lt;beans\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Definition for javaCollection --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;javaCollection\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.JavaCollection\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- java.util.List --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;customList\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; \u0026lt;value\u0026gt;India\u0026lt;/value\u0026gt; \u0026lt;value\u0026gt;Singapore\u0026lt;/value\u0026gt; \u0026lt;value\u0026gt;USA\u0026lt;/value\u0026gt; \u0026lt;value\u0026gt;UK\u0026lt;/value\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/list\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- java.util.Set --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;customSet\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;set\u0026gt; \u0026lt;value\u0026gt;India\u0026lt;/value\u0026gt; \u0026lt;value\u0026gt;Singapore\u0026lt;/value\u0026gt; \u0026lt;value\u0026gt;USA\u0026lt;/value\u0026gt; \u0026lt;value\u0026gt;UK\u0026lt;/value\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/set\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- java.util.Map --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;customMap\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;map\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entry key=\u0026#34;1\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;India\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entry key=\u0026#34;2\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;Singapore\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entry key=\u0026#34;3\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;USA\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;entry key=\u0026#34;4\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;UK\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/map\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- java.util.Properties --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;customProperies\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;props\u0026gt; \u0026lt;prop key=\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;\u0026gt;admin@myorg.com\u0026lt;/prop\u0026gt; \u0026lt;prop key=\u0026#34;support\u0026#34;\u0026gt;support@myorg.com\u0026lt;/prop\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/props\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/beans\u0026gt; \nQ22. How to inject a java.util.Properties into a Spring Bean? You can initialize properties using \u0026lt;props\u0026gt; as below.\n\u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;adminUser\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.common.Customer\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- java.util.Properties --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;emails\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;props\u0026gt; \u0026lt;prop key=\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;\u0026gt;admin@myorg.com\u0026lt;/prop\u0026gt; \u0026lt;prop key=\u0026#34;support\u0026#34;\u0026gt;support@myorg.com\u0026lt;/prop\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/props\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; Alternatively you can use \u0026lt;util:properties\u0026gt; to define properties from a properties file, and use bean reference for setter injection.\n\u0026lt;util:properties id=\u0026#34;emails\u0026#34; location=\u0026#34;classpath:com/foo/emails.properties\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \nQ23. Explain Spring Bean Autowiring? Autowiring allows the Spring container to automatically resolve dependencies between collaborating beans by inspecting the beans that have been defined. Spring Bean Autowiring can be done in three ways:-\n XML-based configuration using \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;store\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Store\u0026#34; autowire=\u0026#34;byType\u0026#34; /\u0026gt;  Annotation-based configuration using @Autowired on properties, setter-methods or constructor public class Store { @Autowired private Item item; }  Java-based configuration using @Bean @Bean(autowire = Autowire.BY_TYPE) public class Store { private Item item; public setItem(Item item){ this.item = item; } }   \nQ24. Explain different Modes of Spring Bean Autowiring? There are five autowiring modes in spring framework. Lets discuss them one by one.\n no: This option is default for spring framework and it means that autowiring is OFF. You have to explicitly set the dependencies using tags in bean definitions. byName: This option enables the dependency injection based on bean names. When autowiring a property in bean, property name is used for searching a matching bean definition in configuration file. If such bean is found, it is injected in property. If no such bean is found, a error is raised. byType: This option enables the dependency injection based on bean types. When autowiring a property in bean, property’s class type is used for searching a matching bean definition in configuration file. If such bean is found, it is injected in property. If no such bean is found, a error is raised. constructor: Autowiring by constructor is similar to byType, but applies to constructor arguments. In autowire enabled bean, it will look for class type of constructor arguments, and then do a autowire by type on all constructor arguments. Please note that if there isn’t exactly one bean of the constructor argument type in the container, a fatal error is raised. autodetect: Autowiring by autodetect uses either of two modes i.e. constructor or byType modes. First it will try to look for valid constructor with arguments, If found the constructor mode is chosen. If there is no constructor defined in bean, or explicit default no-args constructor is present, the autowire byType mode is chosen.\n  Q25. Explain @Required annotation with example? This annotation simply indicates that the affected bean property must be populated at configuration time, through an explicit property value in a bean definition or through autowiring. The container throws BeanInitializationException if the affected bean property has not been populated.\nThis annotation is used to overcome the problem arise with setter-based injection where spring container doesn\u0026rsquo;t warn or throw any exception if all the required properties are not populated.\nWe can use @Required annotation over setter-method of bean property in class file to indicate it is a mandatory property,\npublic class Store { private Item item; public Item getItem() { return item; } @Required public void setItem(Item item) { this.item = item; } } \nQ26. Explain @Autowired annotation with example? This annotation provides more fine-grained control over where and how autowiring should be accomplished. The @Autowired annotation can be used to autowire bean on the setter method just like @Required annotation, constructor, a property or methods with arbitrary names and/or multiple arguments.\nE.g. You can use @Autowired annotation on setter methods to get rid of the \u0026lt;property\u0026gt; element in XML configuration file. When Spring finds an @Autowired annotation used with setter methods, it tries to perform byType autowiring on the method.\nYou can apply @Autowired to constructors as well. A constructor @Autowired annotation indicates that the constructor should be autowired when creating the bean, even if no \u0026lt;constructor-arg\u0026gt; elements are used while configuring the bean in XML file.\npublic class TextEditor { private SpellChecker spellChecker; @Autowired public TextEditor(SpellChecker spellChecker){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;Inside TextEditor constructor.\u0026#34; ); this.spellChecker = spellChecker; } public void spellCheck(){ spellChecker.checkSpelling(); } } And it’s configuration without constructor arguments.\n\u0026lt;beans\u0026gt; \u0026lt;context:annotation-config/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Definition for textEditor bean without constructor-arg --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;textEditor\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.howtodoinjava.TextEditor\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Definition for spellChecker bean --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;spellChecker\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.howtodoinjava.SpellChecker\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/beans\u0026gt; \nQ27. Explain @Qualifier annotation with example? There may be a situation when you create two or more beans of the same type and want to wire only one of them with a property, in such case you can use @Qualifier annotation along with @Autowired to remove the confusion by specifying which exact bean will be wired.\nSee below example, it will autowire a item bean into Store class,\npublic class Store { @Autowired private Item item; } And we have two bean definitions for Item class.\n\u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;store\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Store\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;itemA\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Item\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;Fruit\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;itemB\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Item\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;name\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;Biscuits\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; If you run the above example spring will throw an exception because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know which bean to autowire in Store class, itemA or itemB?\nCaused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No unique bean of type [com.abc.Item] is defined: expected single matching bean but found 2: [itemA, itemB] We can use @Qualifier annotation to wire specific itemA bean like this:-\npublic class Store { @Autowired @Qualifier(\u0026#34;itemA\u0026#34;) private Item item; } \nQ28. What are Spring stereotype annotations? @component vs @service vs @repository vs @controller All the stereotype annotations are used at annotate classes auto-detection and bean configuration. There are mainly 4 types of stereotypes:-\n @Component is a generic stereotype to annotate classes at any layer @Controller is used to annotate classes at API layer, mainly used in Spring MVC applications to define API endpoint and used in conjunction with @RequestMapping annotation which is used to annotate method to maps the request URL. @Service is used to annotate classes at the service layer @Repository is used to annotate classes at the persistence layer, which will act as a database repository\n  Q29. What are JSR-250 annotations?  @PostConstruct − This annotation can be used as an alternate of initialization callback. @PreDestroy − This annotation can be used as an alternate of destruction callback. @Resource − This annotation can be used on fields or setter methods. The @Resource annotation takes a \u0026lsquo;name\u0026rsquo; attribute which will be interpreted as the bean name to be injected. You can say, it follows by-name autowiring semantics.\n  Q30. What happens when you define two beans with same id or same name ? beans.xml \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;sameName\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Foo\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;bar\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;sameName\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Bar\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; When you use two bean with same name (or same id) in single configuration file then \u0026ldquo;BeanDefinitionParsingException – Bean name \u0026lsquo;sameName\u0026rsquo; is already used in this file\u0026rdquo; is thrown by the spring container at the time of loading.\nWhere things get a little interesting is when bean definitions are spread out across many configuration files. Say, for example, the foo bean is defined in beans1.xml while the bar bean is defined in beans2.xml.\nbeans1.xml \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;sameName\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Foo\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; beans2.xml \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;bar\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;sameName\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.Bar\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Now, if the two beans have the same name (or id), surprisingly no exception is thrown by the container!!!\nFileSystemXmlApplicationContext context = new FileSystemXmlApplicationContext( new String[] { \u0026#34;beans1.xml\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;beans2.xml\u0026#34; }); Bar f = (Bar) context.getBean(\u0026#34;sameName\u0026#34;); // works fine The documentation says \u0026ldquo;the last bean definition with the same name (or id) wins, respectively to the order of the xml files.\u0026quot; In the example Java code above, beans2.xml is loaded in the last. Therefore, bean class com.abc.Bar will be loaded.\nyou can always turn off this default behavior and make cause bean ids/names to be unique across all configurations of the container. Look into the DefaultListableBeanFactory setAllowBeanDefinitionOverriding() method.\nQ31. Explain Spring MVC Workflow?  Spring MVC Workflow\n  When you request from spring MVC application then it follow the following sequence:-\n1. Dispatcher Servlet Dispatcher Servlet which is also know as front controller is the core of Spring MVC Workflow and responsible for handling all HTTP request and response. If you are using tomcat as web application server then Dispatcher Servlet need to define in wb.xml\nThe DispatcherServlet receives the entry of handler mapping from the configuration file and forwards the request to the controller. The controller then returns an object of Model And View. The DispatcherServlet checks the entry of view resolver in the configuration file and calls the specified view component.\n2. Handler Mapping Handler Mapping is a configuration for url and controller mapping.\nFollowing are the different implementation of HandlerMapping:-\n1) BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping This is a default spring handler mapping. Name of bean considered as URL.\n\u0026lt;bean name=\u0026#34;/welcome.htm\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.controller.WelcomeController\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; 2) SimpleUrlHandlerMapping Map with key value pair of URL and controller bean name.\n\u0026lt;bean class=\u0026#34;org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.SimpleUrlHandlerMapping\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;property name=\u0026#34;mappings\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;props\u0026gt; \u0026lt;prop key=\u0026#34;/welcome.htm\u0026#34;\u0026gt;welcomeController\u0026lt;/prop\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/props\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bean\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bean id=\u0026#34;welcomeController\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;com.abc.controller.WelcomeController\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; 3) DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping This is the most popular implementation of HandlerMapping where each class annotated with @Controller maps one or more request to methods that process and execute the request with provided inputs.\n@RequestMapping annotation is used at both class and method level to map the URL. In addition to simple use cases, we can use it for mapping of HTTP headers, binding parts of the URI with @PathVariable, and working with URI parameters and the @RequestParam annotation.\npackage com.abc.controller; import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMethod; import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView; @Controller @RequestMapping(\u0026#34;/welcome\u0026#34;) public class WelcomeController{ @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET) public ModelAndView helloWorld(){ ModelAndView model = new ModelAndView(\u0026#34;WelcomePage\u0026#34;); model.addObject(\u0026#34;msg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hello world\u0026#34;); return model; } } 3. Controller Controller calls service layer to execute business logic and return ModelAndView, which is wrapper for model object and view name.\nPopular Controller Types:\nAbstractController\nAbstractCommandController\nSimpleFormController\n4. View Resolver View Resolver look for appropriate view JSP/HTML based on view name.\nPopular Implementations of ViewResolver:\nInternalResourceViewResolver\n5. View Dispatcher Servlet return the view JPS/HTML component to user\nQ32. Differentiate between @Controller and @RestController? @Controller vs @RestController Even though both are used to indicate that a Spring bean is a Controller in Spring MVC setup, @RestController is better when you are developing RESTful web services using Spring MVC framework. It\u0026rsquo;s a combination of @Controller + @ResponseBody annotation which allows the controller to directly write the response and bypassing the view resolution process, which is not required for RESTful web service.\nIt also instructs DispatcherServlet to use different HttpMessageConverters to represent the response in the format client is expecting e.g. HttpMessageJackson2Convert to represent response in JSON format and JAXB based message converts to generate XML response.\nQ33. What Is Spring Security? Spring Security is a separate module of the Spring framework that focuses on providing authentication and authorization methods in Java applications. It also takes care of most of the common security vulnerabilities such as CSRF attacks.\nTo use Spring Security in web applications, you can get started with a simple annotation: @EnableWebSecurity.\nQ34. What Is Aspect-Oriented Programming? Aspect-oriented programming or AOP is a programming technique which allows programmers to modularize crosscutting concerns or behavior that cuts across the typical divisions of responsibility. Examples of cross-cutting concerns can be logging and transaction management. The core of AOP is an aspect. It encapsulates behaviors that can affect multiple classes into reusable modules. Q35. What Are Aspect, Advice, Pointcut, and Joinpoint in Aop?  Aspect: a class that implements cross-cutting concerns, such as transaction management Advice: the methods that get executed when a specific JoinPoint with matching Pointcut is reached in the application Pointcut: a set of regular expressions that are matched with JoinPoint to determine whether Advice needs to be executed or not JoinPoint: a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an exception\n  Q36. What are the different types of Advices? Different types of Advices in Spring AOP are:\n Before: These types of advices execute before the joinpoint methods and are configured using @Before annotation mark. After returning: These types of advices execute after the joinpoint methods completes executing normally and are configured using @AfterReturning annotation mark. After throwing: These types of advices execute only if joinpoint method exits by throwing an exception and are configured using @AfterThrowing annotation mark. After (finally): These types of advices execute after a joinpoint method, regardless of the method’s exit whether normally or exceptional return and are configured using @After annotation mark. Around: These types of advices execute before and after a joinpoint and are configured using @Around annotation mark.\n  Q37. What is cross-cutting concerns in Spring AOP? The concern is the behavior we want to have in a particular module of an application. It can be defined as a functionality we want to implement.\nThe cross-cutting concern is a concern which is applicable throughout the application. This affects the entire application. For example, logging, security and data transfer are the concerns needed in almost every module of an application, thus they are the cross-cutting concerns.\n Spring AOP - Cross Cutting Concerns\n  Q38. What is Weaving? According to the official docs, weaving is a process that links aspects with other application types or objects to create an advised object. This can be done at compile time, load time, or at runtime. Spring AOP, like other pure Java AOP frameworks, performs weaving at runtime.\nQ39. What is Spring Dao? Spring Data Access Object is Spring\u0026rsquo;s support provided to work with data access technologies like JDBC, Hibernate, and JPA in a consistent and easy way.\nThis also allows to switch between the persistence technologies easily. It also allows you to code without worrying about catching exceptions that are specific to each of these technology.\nQ40. What is Spring Jdbctemplate Class and How to Use it? The Spring JDBC template is the primary API through which we can access database operations logic that we’re interested in:\n creation and closing of connections executing statements and stored procedure calls iterating over the ResultSet and returning results  To use it, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to define the simple configuration of DataSource:\n@Configuration @ComponentScan(\u0026#34;com.abc.jdbc\u0026#34;) public class SpringJdbcConfig { @Bean public DataSource mysqlDataSource() { DriverManagerDataSource dataSource = new DriverManagerDataSource(); dataSource.setDriverClassName(\u0026#34;com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\u0026#34;); dataSource.setUrl(\u0026#34;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/springjdbc\u0026#34;); dataSource.setUsername(\u0026#34;guest_user\u0026#34;); dataSource.setPassword(\u0026#34;guest_password\u0026#34;); return dataSource; } } \nQ41. How Would You Enable Transactions in Spring and What Are Their Benefits? There are two distinct ways to configure Transactions – with annotations or by using Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) – each with their advantages.\nThe benefits of using Spring Transactions, according to the official docs, are:\n Provide a consistent programming model across different transaction APIs such as JTA, JDBC, Hibernate, JPA, and JDO Support declarative transaction management Provide a simpler API for programmatic transaction management than some complex transaction APIs such as JTA Integrate very well with Spring\u0026rsquo;s various data access abstractions\n  Q42. What is Spring Boot? Spring boot solves all this problems that comes with Spring Framework and help to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based applications that you can just run.\n Follow the post for Top Spring Boot Interview Questions\n \nSource  Spring 5.0.0.RC3 Official Documentation Baeldung Spring Interview Questions Edureka Spring Interview Questions HowToDoInJava Spring Interview Questions ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/top-spring-interview-questions/","tags":["Interview Q\u0026A","Spring Framework","Spring Q\u0026A"],"title":"Top Spring Interview Questions"},{"categories":["Interview Questions","Java"],"contents":"Comprehensive List of Java Interview Questions based on my personal interview experience over the last few years. Sequence of Questions in each section are in the order of recent interview trends. Keep following this post link for regular updates.\n Also Read Java 8 Interview Questions\nAlso Read Java Multithreading (Concurrency) Interview Questions\n Java Design Patterns Q1. What is Singleton Pattern and how do you implement it? Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.\nThis is one of the most commonly asked question in interviews. Interviewer starts this question asking about design patterns. Candidate generally answers singleton and factory patterns. Then interviewer asks to implement a Singleton Design Pattern Using Java.\nFollow up questions in singleton pattern are as follows:\n How to make singleton class thread safe?\nusing double checked locking How to prevent deserialization to create new object of singleton class?\nusing readResolve method to return same instance How to prevent cloning to create a new object of singleton class?\noverride clone method to return same instance How to prevent reflexion to create a new object of singleton class?\nthrow exception from private constructor if instance already exist  Singleton Class public class Singleton implements Serializable, Cloneable{ private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; private static Singleton instance = null; private static Object DUMMY_OBJECT = new Object(); private Singleton(){ /*To prevent object creation using reflection*/ if(instance!=null){ throw new InstantiationError( \u0026#34;Singleton Object is already created.\u0026#34; ); } } public static Singleton getInstance(){ /*Double checked locking*/ if(instance == null){ synchronized (DUMMY_OBJECT) { if(instance == null){ instance = new Singleton(); } } } return instance; } public static void print(){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;I am a singleton class.\u0026#34;); } /*To prevent object creation using deserialization*/ private Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException{ return instance; } /*To prevent object creation using cloning*/ @Override protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException { return instance; } }  Q2. What is Immutable Object? How do you write an Immutable Class? Immutable Class means that once an object is initialized from this Class, we cannot change the state of that object.\nIn other words, An immutable object can’t be modified after it has been created. When a new value is needed, the accepted practice is to make a copy of the object that has the new value.\nIn order to create an Immutable Class in Java, you should keep following points in mind:-\n Declare the class as final so that it cannot be extended and subclasses will not be able to override methods. Make all the fields as private so direct access in not allowed Make all the fields as final so that value cannot be modified once initialized Provide no setter methods — setter methods are those methods which modify fields or objects referred to by fields. Initialize all the final fields through a constructor and perform a deep copy for mutable objects. If the class holds a mutable object:  Don\u0026rsquo;t provide any methods that modify the mutable objects. Always return a copy of mutable object from getter method and never return the actual object reference.    Let’s apply all the above points and create our immutable class ImmutablePerson\nImmutablePerson.java /** * Immutable class should mark as final so it can not be extended. * Fields should mark as private so direct access is not allowed. * Fields should mark as final so value can not be modified once initialized. **/ public final class ImmutablePerson { // String - immutable  private final String name; // Integer - immutable  private final Integer weight; // Date - mutable  private final Date dateOfBirth; /** * All the final fields are initialized through constructor * Perform a deep copy of immutable objects */ public ImmutablePerson(String name, Integer weight, Date dateOfBirth){ this.name = name; this.weight = weight; this.dateOfBirth = new Date(dateOfBirth.getTime()); } /********************************************** ***********PROVIDE NO SETTER METHODS ********* **********************************************/ /** * String class is immutable so we can return the instance variable as it is **/ public String getName() { return name; } /** * Integer class is immutable so we can return the instance variable as it is **/ public Integer getWeight() { return weight; } /** * Date class is mutable so we need a little care here. * We should not return the reference of original instance variable. * Instead a new Date object, with content copied to it, should be returned. **/ public Date getDateOfBirth() { return new Date(dateOfBirth.getTime()); } @Override public String toString() { return \u0026#34;Person { name: \u0026#34; + name + \u0026#34;, weight: \u0026#34; + weight + \u0026#34;, dateOfBirth: \u0026#34; + new SimpleDateFormat(\u0026#34;dd-MM-yyyy\u0026#34;).format(dateOfBirth) + \u0026#34;}\u0026#34;; } }  Q3. Give example of 5-6 design patterns being used in Java classes.  Factory\njava.util.Calendar#getInstance() Abstract Factory\njavax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory#newInstance()\njavax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory#newInstance()\njavax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory#newInstance() Builder\njava.lang.StringBuilder#append()\njava.lang.StringBuffer#append() Decorator\nAll subclasses of java.io.InputStream, OutputStream, Reader and Writer. Chain of responsibility\njavax.servlet.Filter#doFilter() Iterator\njava.util.Iterator Observer\nJMS message listener Singleton\njava.lang.Runtime#getRuntime() Adapter java.util.Arrays#asList()\njava.io.InputStreamReader(InputStream) (returns a Reader)\njava.io.OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream) (returns a Writer) Immutable\nString, Integer, Byte, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean and Short   Q4. Anti patterns in Java. What is god class? Anti patterns in java is:-\n Any pattern or coding habit which is considered as bad practice Which are against SOLID design principles  God class is one of the Anti pattern example. A god class is a class which is having too many properties or methods or dependencies and hence lots of responsibilities which violates single-responsibility SOLID design principle. Writing thousands lines of code in single class becomes a nightmare to debug, unit-test and document.\nJava DataStructure Q1. How HashMap Works? This is also most commonly asked question in collections. Interviewer start this question asking about collections and what are the data structure/collection you have used in development. Candidate generally answers HashMap, LinkedList, ArrayList, HashSet. Then interviewer check your knowledge of equals, hashcode and hashing algorithm. You should be aware of HashMap class internal implementation.\n Read Design your own HashMap in Java for HashMap implementation. Follow up questions in HashMap are as follows:\n  How to use HashMap in multi threading environment?\nYou should know that HashTable is thread safe. You can make HashMap thread safe by using Collections.synchronizedMap(Map) What is Concurrent HashMap? How it is better then thread safe HashMap in multi threading environment?\nSynchronized HashMap locks the whole map when one thread is accessing it resulting into other thread to wait. Concurrent HashMap provides the better performance by locking only the specific segment (similar to bucket in hashmap) rather than blocking whole map. By default, there are 16 segments, means 16 locks, means 16 concurrency level, means 16 threads can access 16 different segment of the map at the same time.\n  Q2. What is the difference in ArrayList and LinkedList? ArrayList vs LinkedList     ArrayList LinkedList     1. ArrayList implements List and RandomAccess interfaces LinkedList implements List and Deque interface   2. ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store the elements. LinkedList internally uses a doubly linked list to store the elements.   3. ArrayList elements are stored in contiguous memory location where each memory location represents an index Each LinkedList element can be stored at different memory location where each element has address of it previous and next element.   4. Insertion and Deletion of elements is slow in ArrayList as these operations require all the elements to shift by one index to either make the space or fill the empty space Insertion and Deletion of elements is faster in LinkedList as these operations just require to change the addresses in previous and next block   5. Read operation of random element is much faster in ArrayList due to indices and support of fast random access Read operation of random element in slower in LinkedList as need to traverse the list of find element   6. Recommended when read operation is more than the number of insertions and deletions Recommended when insertion and deletion rate is higher then the read operation       methods ArrayList LinkedList     get(int index) O(1) O(n) with n/4 steps on average   getFirst(), getLast() NA O(1)   add(int index, E element) O(n) with n/2 steps on average O(n) with n/4 steps on average   addFirst(), addLast() NA O(1)   remove(int index) O(n) with n/2 steps on average O(n) with n/4 steps on average   removeFirst(), removeLast() NA O(1)   Iterator.remove() O(n) with n/2 steps on average O(1)   ListIterator.add(E element) O(n) with n/2 steps on average O(1)     ArrayList: Many of the operations need n/2 steps on average, constant number of steps in the best case (end of list), n steps in the worst case (start of list) LinkedList: Many of the operations need n/4 steps on average, constant number of steps in the best case (e.g. index = 0), and n/2 steps in worst case (middle of list)\n  Q3. How to find middle element of Linked List?  It is always better to keep track of Linked list size by increasing or decreasing the counter by 1, on addition or deletion of nodes from linked list respectively. In this way, middle element\u0026rsquo;s index will be (size -1)/2 When size of the linked list is unknown and only head node is given then you should use Fast and Slow pointer approach.\nIn this approach, we iterate through the linked list using two pointers. Fast pointer jumps 2 nodes in each iteration, and the slow pointer jumps only one node per iteration.\nWhen the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle element.   Also read How to find middle element of LinkedList in Java for more details\n  Q4. How to find a loop in LinkedList? If you answer it then follow up question might be asked:\n How to find the starting point of loop in LinkedList? How to find the length of the loop in LinkedList?\n  Q5. Difference between ArrayList and Vector. These is legacy interview questions which is not asked frequently now a days but good to know.\nArrayList vs Vector     ArrayList Vector     1. ArrayList\u0026rsquo;s methods are not synchronized Vector\u0026rsquo;s methods are synchronized   2. ArrayList is fast as it’s non-synchronized. Vector is slow because it is synchronized   3. If internal array runs out of room, ArrayList increases its size by 50% Vector defaults to doubling size of its array   4. ArrayList can only use Iterator for traversing Vector can use both Enumeration and Iterator for traversing over elements    Java String Q1. What is String Constant Pool? String Constant Pool is a pool of Strings (String literals) stored in Java Heap Memory. A dedicated space is provided for pool in Heap Memory.\nWhen you ask for a string from this pool, it provides the same string if already exist, otherwise it creates a new string in the pool and returns that string. This process is also called as string intern which makes the string literals reusable.\nQ2. Difference between String Literal and New String Object. String literal vs New String Object    String Literals New String Object     String literals are maintained in String Constant Pool New String objects are created in Heap Memory   String literals are interned by default New String objects can be interned explicitly using intern() method    // String Literal  String a = \u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;; String b = \u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;; System.out.println(a == b); // true  // String Object  String c = new String(\u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;); String d = new String(\u0026#34;abc\u0026#34;); System.out.println(c == d); // false  System.out.println(a == d); // false  System.out.println(a == d.intern()); // true  System.out.println(c.intern() == d.intern()); //true \nQ3. Difference between String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer. String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer  String object is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder objects are mutable. String\u0026rsquo;s concat \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; operator internally uses StringBuffer or StringBuilder class.  StringBuilder vs StringBuffer  StringBuilder and StringBuffer provides similar methods such as substring(), insert(), append(), delete() StringBuffer is thread safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not, thats why StringBuilder is more faster than StringBuffer. Most of the time you will be using StringBuilder. Use StringBuffer if you really are trying to share a buffer between threads.\n  Q4. Why char[] array is used over String to store password in Java? Strings are immutable in Java and any change in a String object produces a new String. When you store passwords in a String object, they stays in memory until Garbage collector clear it, which is a security threat as anyone with access to the memory dump retrieve the password from memory.\nMoreover, String use String Pool memory for reusability, which even stays in memory for long duration as compare to other objects.\nWhereas if password is stored in char[] array, we can explicitly wipe the password after completing the work. The array can be overwritten and password will no longer be there in memory.\nJava OOPS Java OOPS concepts are very frequently asked interview questions for Java beginners.\nQ1. What is Polymorphism in Java? Polymorphism means \u0026ldquo;many forms\u0026rdquo;, and it allows us to perform same action on an object in different ways.\nThere are two types of polymorphism in java:\n Static Polymorphism also known as compile time polymorphism - example is Method Overloading Dynamic Polymorphism also known as runtime polymorphism - example is Method Overriding   Q2. Explain Overloading in Java? Method Overloading is a Compile time polymorphism. In method overloading, method name must be same, but method arguments must be different by number or type or both. In method overloading, return type can be same or different, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the overloading.\npublic class Calculator { // base-method \tpublic int add(int a, int b) { return a+b; } // throw compile time error - duplicate method \t// we can not overload base-method by just changing return type \tpublic long add(int a, int b) { return a+b; } // overloaded method - number of arguments (3) are different than base-method (2) \tpublic int add(int a, int b, int c) { return a+b+c; } // overloaded method - argument types are different than base-method \tpublic String add(String a, String b) { return a+b; } }  Q3. Explain Overriding in Java? Method Overriding is a Run time polymorphism. In method overriding, derived (child) class provides the specific implementation of the method that is already provided by the base (parent) class. In method overriding, method signature must be same i.e. method name, arguments and return type.\npackage com.example.core.oops; public class Overiding { public static void main(String[] args) { Animal animal = new Animal(); animal.makeSound(); // prints \u0026#34;Animal making sound\u0026#34;  Animal dog = new Dog(); dog.makeSound(); // prints \u0026#34;Bow Bow\u0026#34;  Animal cat = new Cat(); cat.makeSound(); // prints \u0026#34;Meow Meow\u0026#34; \t} } class Animal { public void makeSound() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Animal making sound\u0026#34;); } } class Dog extends Animal { public void makeSound() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Bow Bow\u0026#34;); } } class Cat extends Animal { public void makeSound() { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Meow Meow\u0026#34;); } }  Q4. Can you Override a static method and private method ?  No, you cannot override static method since static method is associated with a class whereas overriding is an object instance feature. No, you cannot override private method since private method is not visible outside of a class.\n  Q5. What is multiple Inheritance? Is it supported by Java? If a child class inherits the property from multiple classes is known as multiple inheritance. Java does not allow to extend multiple classes.\nThe problem with multiple inheritance is that if multiple parent classes have the same method name, then at runtime it becomes difficult for the compiler to decide which method to execute from the child class.\nTherefore, Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. The problem is commonly referred to as Diamond Problem.\n\nJava Basics Java Basics interview questions are very frequently asked from freshers.\nQ1. Explain each keyword in main method i.e. public static void main(String[] args). public class MyClass { public static void main(String[] args) {} }  public method have public access and can be executed from outside the class. It has to be public so that java runtime can execute this method. static associates the method with class rather than object. This helps JVM to call main method without class instantiation. void is a return type of main method which returns nothing main is name of java main method and it is fixed. When you execute a class fine, it looks for main method. String[] args is used to pass Java command line arguments and is an array of type String   Q2. What is final keyword in Java? The final keyword is used as non-access modifier in Java. A final keyword can be used in different contexts such as:\n  Value of final variable cannot be changed once assigned.\n  A final method cannot be overridden by inheriting child classes in Java.\n  A final class cannot be extended by other classes in Java.\n/** final class cannot be extended */ final class A { /** final variable value cannot be changed */ private final var; /** final method cannot be overridden */ public void final method() {} }    Q3. Difference between final, finally and finalize?  final is used to apply restrictions on class, methods and variables. final class can\u0026rsquo;t be inherited, final method can\u0026rsquo;t be overridden and final variable value can\u0026rsquo;t be changed once assigned. finally is used along with try and catch block for exception handling. finally block is always executed whether an exception is handled or not. finally block is generally used to clean up the resources such as closing the IO streams and connections. finalize is an Object\u0026rsquo;s class protected method which is called by the garbage collector on an object that isn\u0026rsquo;t referenced anymore and have been selected for garbage collection. The method is called before the object is released from the memory by GC. We cannot control when garbage control happens and should not depend on the finalize() method to perform clean up activities. class FinalizeObject { @Override protected void finalize() throws Throwable { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Execute finalize method\u0026#34;); super.finalize(); } public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { FinalizeObject object = new FinalizeObject(); object = null; /** Request JVM to perform garbage collection */ System.gc(); } }    Q4. Explain JDK, JRE and JVM    JDK JRE JVM     It stands for Java Development Kit It stands for Java Runtime Environment It stands for Java Virtual Machine   JDK = JDK + JRE + JVM JRE = JRE + JVM JVM = JVM   It contains JRE, JVM, interpreter/loader(java), compiler(javac), debugger, archiver(jar), document generator(JavaDoc) It contains JVM, Class libraries and other supporting files It is a virtual machine contains ClassLoader, Method Area, Heap, Stack memory   You can compile, document, debug, or archive a Java Program with JDK You can execute a Java Program with only JRE, You don\u0026rsquo;t need JDK JVM translates the bytecode to native machine code     Q5. Why Java is Platform Independent? Java is platform independent. Let\u0026rsquo;s understand this\n When you write a program in Java (.java file) and compile it using javac. It is converted to ByteCode (.class file). This ByteCode is not something which any machine or OS can understand. You need an interpreter to execute this ByteCode and that interpreter is JVM (Java Virtual Machine) in case of Java. JVM is platform dependent. You need to install platform specific JVM based on Operating System you are using Mac OS X, Windows or Linux. You can execute the same ByteCode (.class file) on any platform\u0026rsquo;s JVM regardless of its Operating System.  So we can say, JVM is platform dependent but Java is platform independent from its magic ByteCode.\nQ6. How many ways to create an Object Instance in Java ?  New Keyword Cloning using Object.clone() method Reflection using Class.newInstance() method Reflection using Class.getConstructor().newInstance() method Object Serialization and Deserialization  public class ObjectInstance { public static void main(String[] args) throws CloneNotSupportedException, InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException, IllegalArgumentException, InvocationTargetException, NoSuchMethodException, SecurityException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException { // New Keyword \tObjectInstance instance1 = new ObjectInstance(); // Cloning \tObjectInstance instance2 = (ObjectInstance) instance1.clone(); // Reflection \tObjectInstance instance3 = ObjectInstance.class.newInstance(); ObjectInstance instance4 = ObjectInstance.class.getConstructor().newInstance(); // Object Serialization and Deserialization \tserialize(instance1); ObjectInstance instance5 = deserialize(); } private static void serialize(ObjectInstance objInstance) throws IOException { FileOutputStream f = new FileOutputStream(\u0026#34;resources/objectinstance.ser\u0026#34;); try (ObjectOutputStream outputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(f)) { outputStream.writeObject(objInstance); outputStream.flush(); } } private static ObjectInstance deserialize() throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException { FileInputStream f = new FileInputStream(\u0026#34;resources/objectinstance.ser\u0026#34;); try (ObjectInputStream inputStream = new ObjectInputStream(f)) { return (ObjectInstance) inputStream.readObject(); } } }  Q7. What is Marker Interface? A Marker interface is an empty interface (having no fields and methods). Examples of Marker interface are:-\njava.io.Serializable,\njava.lang.Cloneable,\njava.rmi.Remote,\njava.util.RandomAccess etc.\nMarker Interface provides runtime information about objects to compiler and JVM. Now annotations are used for the same purpose instead of Marker Interface.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create our own marker interface Deletable to indicate whether an object can be removed from the database.\npublic interface Deletable {} public class Entity implements Deletable { // implementation details } public class ShapeDao { // other dao methods  public boolean delete(Object object) { if (!(object instanceof Deletable)) { return false; } // delete implementation details  return true; } }  Q8. What is Autoboxing and Unboxing in Java?  Autoboxing is automatic conversion of primitive type to its object wrapper class such as int to Integer by Java Compiler //Autoboxing char to Character Character c = \u0026#39;a\u0026#39;; //Autoboxing int to Integer List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; list = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); list.add(1);  Unboxing is automatic conversion of object wrapper class to its primitive type such as Double to Double by Java Compiler //Unboxing Double to double List\u0026lt;Double\u0026gt; list = new ArrayList\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); list.add(3.1416); double pi = list.get(0);    Q9. Why use Generics? Generics enables types to be parameterized when defining classes and methods so that we can re-use the same code with different types.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s understand this by creating a generic class Element and methods set and get\npublic class Element\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { // T stands for \u0026#34;Type\u0026#34; \tprivate T t; public void set(T t) { this.t = t; } public T get() { return t; } } Now can re-use the same code with different types such as Integer and String as follows:-\nElement\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; num = new Element\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); num.set(2); System.out.println(num.get()); Element\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; str = new Element\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); str.set(\u0026#34;generics\u0026#34;); System.out.println(str.get());  Q10. What are the restrictions on Generics?  Cannot instantiate Generic classes with primitive type List\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; num = new List\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(); // compile-time error  Cannot create instance of Type parameter public static \u0026lt;E\u0026gt; void append(List\u0026lt;E\u0026gt; list) { E elem = new E(); // compile-time error  list.add(elem); }  Cannot declare parametrized static field in Generic class public class List\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { // static field type cannot be parametrized since it belongs to class not class-object of type T  private static T os; }  Cannot use casts or instanceof with Generic Class public static \u0026lt;E\u0026gt; void rtti(List\u0026lt;E\u0026gt; list) { if (list instanceof ArrayList\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;) { // compile-time error  // ...  } }  Cannot create Array of Generic class List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;[] arrayOfLists = new List\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;[2]; // compile-time error  Cannot overload a method using same Generic class with different types public class Example { public void print(Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; strSet) { } public void print(Set\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt; intSet) { } // compile-time error }   Java Memory Q1. What is the difference between Heap and Stack Memory in Java?    Features Stack Heap     Memory Stack memory is used only by one thread of execution. Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application.   Access Stack memory can’t be accessed by other threads. Objects stored in the heap are globally accessible.   Memory Management Follows LIFO manner to free memory. Memory management is based on the generation associated with each object.   Lifetime Exists until the end of execution of the thread. Heap memory lives from the start till the end of application execution.   Usage Stack memory only contains local primitive and reference variables to objects in heap space. Whenever an object is created, it’s always stored in the Heap space.     Q2. What is Java Memory Model? JVM Memory is having separate space for Heap and Permanent Generation Memory\n┌------------------- Heap ------------------┐ ┌-- Non-Heap --┐ ┌------------- New -----------┐ ┌--- Old ---┐ ┌―――――――――┬―――――――――┬――――――――――┬―――――――――――――┬―――――――――――――――┐ │ Eden │ S0 │ S1 │ Tenured │ Permanent │ └―――――――――┴―――――――――┴――――――――――┴―――――――――――――┴―――――――――――――――┘ Heap Memory  Heap is divided into 2 parts - New (Young) Generation and Old Generation. Heap space is allocated as per -Xms (Initial Heap Size) when JVM starts up and it can increase upto -Xmx (Max Heap Size)  New (Young) Generation  New Generation includes 3 parts - Eden Space and two Survivor Space (S0, S1) New Generation space is allocated as per -XX:NewSize when JVM starts up and it can increase upto -XX:MaxNewSize All newly created objects first live here, and GC\u0026rsquo;ed if they are unused (most die young) Minor GC is performed when Eden Space is full  Mark Copy (Minor GC)  Young Generation ┌―――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――┐ │ Eden Space │ │――――――――――――――――――┬――――――――――――――――――│ │ Survivor Space 1 │ Survivor Space 2 │ └――――――――――――――――――┴――――――――――――――――――┘ 1st Minor GC 1. Keep allocating in Eden space 2. Once full, trigger minor GC 3. Mark all live objects in Eden 4. Copy it over to empty survivor space (S1) 5. Reclaim whole Eden space as empty 2nd Minor GC 1. Keep allocating in Eden space 2. Once full, trigger minor GC 3. Mark all live objects in Eden 4. Copy it over to empty survivor space (S2) 5. Copy live objects of S1 to S2 6. Reclaim both Eden and S1 as empty 3rd Minor GC ... 5. Copy live objects of S2 to S1 6. Reclaim both Eden and S2 as empty Old Generation  Object moved here after surviving multiple Minor GC OR If Objects are too big for young generation. Major GC is performed when Old Generation is full.

What are Different Types of Garbage Collectors?    Collector Pros Cons Threads Use-Case     SerialGC Smallest Footprint Slow Use Single Thread for both Minor and Major GC Programs with small memory, or running on shared CPU   ParallelGC High Throughput High STW Pauses Use multiple threads for minor and single thread for major GC Batch applications   ParallelOldGC High Throughput High STW Pauses Use multiple threads for both minor and major GC Batch applications   ConcurrentMarkSweepGC Low STW Pauses (Concurrent Mark) Reduced Throughput Use one or more threads for both minor and major GC General Application   G1GC Region Based, Can set STW Pause threshold, Low Latency, High Throughput High Footprint  Big Applications with large heap    *Footprint:- Amount of memory required by GC algo to run\n*STW (Stop the world):- GC doesn\u0026rsquo;t run with application. When GC is running, all application processes are stopped.\nSerial vs Parallel GC  Serial and Parallel both cause stop-the-world during GC operation Serial collector uses only one GC thread whereas Parallel collector uses multiple GC threads. Parallel collector provide high throughput due to multiple threads  Parallel vs CMS GC ConcurrentMarkSweep (CMS) performs following Steps:-\ninitial mark (STW with multiple GC threads) concurrent tracing (one or more GC threads runs with application) remark (STW with multiple GC threads) concurrent sweep (one or more GC threads runs with application)  Parallel collector stop-the-world throughout GC operation means 1 high STW pause. CMS stop-the-world only during initial mark and remark phase, during concurrent mark and sweep phase, CMS threads run along with application\u0026rsquo;s thread means 2 low STW pauses.   Q4. Can you force the JVM to perform garbage collection from a Java program? You cannot force the JVM to perform garbage collection. you can only suggest or indicate to the JVM to perform garbage collection using System.gc().\n Q5. How to do JVM Performance tuning?  Heap and Stack Memory: -Xms512m sets the initial heap size to 512MB -Xmx512m sets the max heap size to 512MB, recommended to same as -Xms -Xss thread stack size -XX:NewSize=128m new generation size typically set 1/4th the size of heap -XX:MaxNewSize=128m max new generation size, recommended to same as -XX:NewSize -XX:NewRatio=2 old to young ratio means the old generation occupies 2/3 of the heap while the young generation occupies 1/3 -XX:SurvivorRatio=6 eden to survivor ratio) means each survivor occupies 1/8 of young generation while eden occupies 6/8  Permanent Generation Memory -XX:PermSize -XX:MaxPermSize  Garbage Collection -XX:+UseSerialGC, -XX:+UseParallelGC (-XX:ParallelGCThreads=\u0026lt;N\u0026gt;), -XX:+UseParallelOldGC, -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC (-XX:ParallelCMSThreads=\u0026lt;N\u0026gt;), -XX:+UseG1GC    JVM Performance Tuning using Parameters\n  *Permanent Generation is replaced by Metaspace from Java 8 onwards\n Q6. What are Java Profilers? Java profilers are used to monitor and debug performance and memory leak issues in development and production environment.\nJava VisualVM is a profiling tool which provide a GUI to profile Java applications. It comes bundled with JDK and relies on other standalone tools provided in the JDK, such as JConsole, jstat, jstack, jinfo, and jmap.\nOther famous JVM profilers are JProfiler and YourKit.\nSome of the features of JVM profilers are:-\n Can use for debugging both local and remote applications Tracking all the JVM details (CPU Usage, Threads, Memory, ClassLoader) Allow to manually run the Garbage Collection Allow to take Heap Dump and Thread Dump CPU Profiling: Debug method execution with stack strace and time taken by each method in stack trace for any performance issue Memory Profiling: Debug the heap and stack memory usage for any possible memory leak.  The JVM Profilers such as VisualVM, JProfiler, and YourKit requires direct connection to the monitored JVM and slow down the application. That is the reason they are mostly used in development environment and not favorable for production use.\nAPM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools such as AppDynamics, New Relic, and DynaTrace are used in production environment instead. APM tools works as Java Agent Profiler which use Java Instrumentation API to inject code into your application. This provides granular level access of the application without affecting the performance.\nJava Theory Q1. S.O.L.I.D. (5 class design principle) in Java? These 5 design principle are know as SOLID principles:-\n Single Responsibility Principle - One class should have one and only one responsibility. We should not write thousands lines of code in a single class (a.k.a. God Class), instead we should refactor and layer our classes such as Controllers (API), Services (Business Logic), Repositories (Database Connection) for application development. Open Close Principle - Software entities (Classes and methods) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. We should not change the code of existing class or method to add new functionality, instead we should inherit the Class or overload/override the Method. Liskov Substitution - Child class should be able to substitute Parent class during runtime polymorphism. Interface Segregation - Clients should not be forced to implement unnecessary methods which they will not use Dependency Inversion - Depend on abstractions (interfaces and abstract classes), instead of concrete implementations (classes).\n  Q2. Does Singleton Pattern Follow S.O.L.I.D. Principle? Singleton pattern do not follow SOLID principle.\n Singleton class has additional responsibility of providing single instance along with other responsibility such as e.g. Database connection, Configuration Manager. Singleton class is not open for extension, not inheritable.\n  Q3. How classes are related to each other through association, aggregation and composition.  Association (bidirectional one to one, one to many, many to one or many to many association, represented by line with arrow in UML) for e.g. Teacher and Student. Multiple students can associate with a single teacher and a single student can associate with multiple teachers but there is no ownership between the objects and both have their own lifecycle. Aggregation (Has-a relationship, unidirectional association, parent and child can survive individually, represented by line with diamond in UML) for e.g. Car and Wheel. Car can have multiple wheels but wheel can not belong to multiple cars and if we delete the car, wheel need not to be destroyed and used in another car. Composition (Part-of relationship, unidirectional association, child can not survive without parent, represented by line with filled diamond in UML) for e.g. House and Rooms. House can contain multiple rooms there is no independent life of room and any room can not belongs to two different house if we delete the house room will automatically delete.

Keep following this post for regular updates.\nWhat do you understand from CSS? CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet, which is used to beautify and paint HTML elements. It tells the browser about HTML element\u0026rsquo;s style such as color, size, margin, padding etc.\nCascading means that multiple styles can be applied to same HTML element. These styles can be cascaded down to multiple style sheets.\nIn practice, styling on a single HTML elements can be applied from:-\n Browser\u0026rsquo;s default style sheet Imported styles sheets from thirdparty (for e.g. bootstrap.css) Imported style sheets from application\u0026rsquo;s theme (for e.g. dark-theme.css) Styles defined in the same HTML document using \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; element Element\u0026rsquo;s inline styles using style attribute  Which style to be applied on HTML element is decided based on CSS Precedence Rules and CSS Specificity.\nWhat are different ways to apply CSS styles? You will, of course, need to know how to add CSS to a page, and there are three main ways:\n  Using the inline style attribute on an element\n\u0026lt;div style=\u0026#34;width:100%; padding:10px; font-size:1.2em; text-align:center;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; CSS Tutorial \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;   Using a \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; block in the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; section of your HTML\n\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; div { width: 100%; padding: 10px; } .heading { font-size: 1.2em; text-align: center; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;heading\u0026#34;\u0026gt;CSS Tutorial\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt;   Loading an external CSS file using the  tag\n\u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;/css/styles.css\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;heading\u0026#34;\u0026gt;CSS Tutorial\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; /css/styles.css\ndiv { width: 100%; padding: 10px; } .heading { font-size: 1.2em; text-align: center; }   The first two are useful but you’ll almost always be loading external CSS files. It’s more maintainable to keep your styles in separate files, not to mention it’s a nice separation of concerns.\nWhat are different ways to use CSS selectors? There are mainly three ways to use CSS selector to specify element to apply CSS.\n Element Selector use the HTML element tag name in css like h1, p, div Class Selector define a Class using class=\u0026quot;heading\u0026quot; attribute on an element and use like .heading Id Selector define an Id using id=\u0026quot;title\u0026quot; attribute on an element and use like #title Universal Selector used as a wildcard character * applied to all the elements on the page. Group Selector multiple selectors using comma separated Elements, Classes, Ids.  \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; /* Element Selector */ div { width: 100%; padding: 10px; } /* Class Selector */ .heading { font-size: 1.2em; text-align: center; } /* Id Selector */ #title { color: red; } /* Universal Selector */ * { color: black; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; } /* Group Selector */ h1, h2, .heading, #title { text-align: center; color: blue; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;title\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;heading\u0026#34;\u0026gt;CSS Tutorial\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; What are the CSS Precedence Rules and CSS Specificity? CSS specificity is the set of rules applied to determine which style is applied to an element. Order of css specificity from highest to lowest is as follows:-\n A css rule with !important always takes precedence. Element\u0026rsquo;s inline style overrides all other styles (1,0,0,0) Css selector using element\u0026rsquo;s #id (0,1,0,0) Css selector using element\u0026rsquo;s .class, pseudo class or attribute (0,0,1,0) Css selector using element name h1, p, div (0,0,0,1) Css selector appear later in the code override earlier one if both have the same specificity  Good read to understand how to calculate specificity\nShould you use !importance As we know now that !importance has highest specificity, nothing can beat that, apart from another !importance. Sometimes there is no way escaping this one when you are struggling with specificity but then it makes debugging difficult.

Pseudo elements are used to style particular parts of an element, rather than the whole thing. For example, you can use it to style the first line or first letter of a paragraph, text you’ve selected, or you can use it to insert text or shapes before or after an element.\nThey always start with a double colon ::, although a single colon : is still allowed for backwards compatibility. Few examples:-\np::first-line {} span::first-letter {} p::selection {} .header::after {} .tooltip::before {} What are pseudo classes? Pseudo classes are similar to pseudo elements, but instead of styling a part of an element, they apply styles when an element is in a certain state. For example, you could style a button differently based on whether the user has their mouse pointer over it, or when they click the button.\nAnother common use case is to style only certain occurrences of elements in a row. For example, styling the first tab in a series of tabs, or every second tab.\nThey all start with a single colon ::. Few Examples:-\nbutton:hover {} a:link {} /* Unvisited links */ a:active {} /* Active links */ a:visited {} /* Visited links */ input:focus {} input:disabled {} input:invalid {} input:required {} input:read-only {} input[type=\u0026#34;checkbox\u0026#34;]:checked {} tr:first-child {} /* First row of table */ tr:last-child {} /* Last row of table */ tr:nth-child(2) {} /* Second row of table */ tr:nth-child(2n) {} /* All even number rows */ tr:nth-last-child(2) {} /* Second last row */ Explain CSS Box Model? The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element such as div. It consists of following:-\n Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear Padding - A transparent area outside the content Border - A border that goes around the padding and content Margin - A transparent area outside the border  Margin Border Padding Content      CSS box model example A typical css to create a box model\ndiv { width: 100px; height: 100px; margin: 20px; border: 5px solid red; padding: 10px; }  CSS Tricks to apply margin and padding Single value margin and padding applies to all sides top, right, bottom and left. Following are different ways to apply margin or padding to individual side or in pairs or in groups.\n/* same padding on all 4 sides */ div { padding: 10px; } /* padding in pair, top/bottom (10px), left/right (20px) */ div { padding: 10px 20px; } /* three values padding, top (10px), bottom (20px) and left/right (30px) */ div { padding: 10px 20px 30px; } /* individual padding , in TRBL (top-right-bottom-left) order */ div { /* top right bottom left */ padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px; } /* individual padding css */ div { padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 30px; padding-left: 40px; }  CSS box-sizing By default width and height property of a box only includes content and do not consider border and padding. This is default css box-sizing:content-box. In this case actual width of box would become 100px (width) + 10px (padding) + 5px (border) = 115px;\nIf you do not want padding and border to change the width of the box, box-sizing:border-box is your css. This css adjust the width of the content to to include padding and border in same width. In this case actual width of the box would remain 100px (width) and content width will be adjusted to 100px (width) - 10px (padding) - 5px (border) = 85px;\nDifference between visibility:hidden and display:none?    visibility:hidden; display:none;     Hides the element Hides the element   Occupy Space Do not occupy space   Affect the layout Do not affect the layout    How would you use media query in CSS3 ? We can not avoid media queries in responsive web applications. We can provide different styling for different devices such as Mobile, Tablet, Laptop and Desktop using media queries.\nThe most common approach is mobile first where all styles targeted for mobile devices and we progressively change styles for other devices using media queries.\n\nCSS media query example /* Mobile */ body { font-size: 1em; } /* Tablet */ @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) { body { font-size: 1.25em; } } /* Desktop and Laptop */ @media only screen and (min-width : 1224px) { body { font-size: 1.5em; } } /* Large Screen */ @media only screen and (min-width : 1824px) { body { font-size: 1.75em; } } Difference between inline, inline-block and block display?     inline inline-bock block     Start on a new line No No Yes   Can set hight and width No Yes Yes   Can set left/right margin \u0026amp; padding Yes Yes Yes   Can set top/bottom margin \u0026amp; padding No Yes Yes    Example  .item { background-color: #c33; padding: 2px; margin: 2px; color: white; border: 1px solid black; } .inline-block { display: inline-block; height: 50px; margin-top: 10px; line-height: 40px; } .block { height: 50px; margin-top: 10px; line-height: 40px; text-align: center; } .title { text-align: center; } .box { flex: 1; margin-right: 10px; background:#f5f5f5; border: 1px solid black; }  display:inline; inline inline inline  display:inline-block; inline-block inline-block inline-block  display:block; block block    What do you understand from Static, Relative, Absolute and Fixed position?  Static - this is the default value, the element is positioned according to normal flow of the page. Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position. Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent. Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window. Sticky - the element is positioned based on the user\u0026rsquo;s scroll position.  /* block 1, 2, 4, and 6 are at their default static normal position */ div.block-1, div.block-2, div.block-4, div.block-6 { position: static; } /* block 3 is relative to its normal position b/w block 2 and 4. Consume the space of normal position b/w 2 and 4 */ div.block-3 { position: relative; top: 20px; left: 20px; } /* block 5 is absolute to its parent container (red border) */ div.block-5 { position: absolute; top: 80px; left: 0px; } /* block 7 sticks to the top when you scroll down in parent container (red border) */ div.block-7 { position: sticky; top: 0px; }  div.css-position-blocks{ width: 100%; height: 110px; position: relative; border: 3px red solid; overflow: auto; } div.css-position-blocks div { display: inline-block; width: 50px; height: 50px; border: 1px solid black; text-align: center; vertical-align: top; font-size: 2rem; } div.block-2 { position: static; } div.block-3 { position: relative; top: 20px; left: 20px; } div.block-5 { position: absolute; top: 81px; left: 0px; } div.block-7 { position: sticky; top: 0px; }  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 We see absolute 5, relative 3 and sticky 7\n Which unit of measurement you use for font-size? Something that has almost always come up for me is the way you size your text, mainly focused on the units you use. You can of course use pixels (px), but there’s also em, rem, %, vs and vh, along with a few others. Some people still don’t like using pixels, but browsers have improved and they’re generally handled pretty well.\nDefining your font sizes in em allows you to change the size of your text based on the size defined at a higher level. For example, if a container has specified a font-size of 2em, and you specify a font-size of 2em on an element inside that container, that element has an effective font-size of 4em! However, this can be a little confusing as you might not always see the size you expect!\n.container { font-size: 2em; } .container \u0026gt; p { font-size: 2em; /* this is 2em x 2em = 4em! */ } The rem unit was created to remedy that confusion. It scales well in the browser, just like em and px, but it uses a base size. From that, all further rem values are calculated. For example, if your base rem value is equal to 16px, then 1rem will always be equal to 16px, 2rem will always be equal to 32px, and so on.\nNote: While I’ve explained these units using font-sizes, the same rules apply to any dimensions where you use px, em or rem.\n Also read CSS units for font-size: px, em and rem\n Do you know about Normalize CSS and Reset CSS? Each browser like Chrome, Firefox, IE has their own default styling for HTML elements also known as browser\u0026rsquo;s user agent styles.If you render a pure HTML page like below without any styling, page will look different in different browser as their user agent styling is applied.\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;H1 Title\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;H2 Title\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;H3 Title\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;H4 Title\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;H5 Title\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;H6 Title\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://codingnconcepts.com/\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Coding N Concepts\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;CSS\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;  Reset CSS Reset CSS resets all the default styles of browser. It says we don\u0026rsquo;t need browser\u0026rsquo;s default at all, we will define as per our need. One of the example is Eric Meyer’s reset.css\nreset.css /* http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ v2.0 | 20110126 License: none (public domain) */ html, body, div, span, applet, object, iframe, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre, a, abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code, del, dfn, em, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp, small, strike, strong, sub, sup, tt, var, b, u, i, center, dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li, fieldset, form, label, legend, table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td, article, aside, canvas, details, embed, figure, figcaption, footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, output, ruby, section, summary, time, mark, audio, video { margin: 0; padding: 0; border: 0; font-size: 100%; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; } /* HTML5 display-role reset for older browsers */ article, aside, details, figcaption, figure, footer, header, hgroup, menu, nav, section { display: block; } body { line-height: 1; } ol, ul { list-style: none; } blockquote, q { quotes: none; } blockquote:before, blockquote:after, q:before, q:after { content: \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; content: none; } table { border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0; }  Normalize CSS Normalize CSS is an alternate for CSS reset. Instead of wiping out all styles, provides cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements.\nThat means, that if we look at the W3C standards of the styles applied by the browsers, and there is an in inconsistency in one of the browsers, the normalize.css styles will fix the browser style that has the difference. Some part of Necolas normalize.css\nnormalize.css /* Add the correct font weight in Chrome, Edge, and Safari. */ b, strong { font-weight: bolder; } /* Remove the border on images inside links in IE 10. */ img { border-style: none; } /* Correct the padding in Firefox. */ fieldset { padding: 0.35em 0.75em 0.625em; } What are CSS sprites and why would use them? If a web page has a large number of images that take a longer time to load because each image separately sends out an HTTP request. The concept of CSS sprites is used to reduce the loading time for a web page because it combines the various small images into one image. It reduces the number of HTTP requests and hence the loading time.\nSay you have to show flags of 100 countries on web page, instead of making 100 HTTP requests from browser, combine all the flags in one image known as sprite flags.png and load them in single HTTP request. Each flag will be shown on the HTML page by displaying a part of sprite image using background-position CSS property.\nCSS Sprite Example .flags-canada, .flags-london, .flags-usa { background-image: url(\u0026#39;../images/flags.png\u0026#39;); background-repeat: no-repeat; } .flags-canada { height: 128px; background-position: -5px -5px; } .flags-usa { height: 135px; background-position: -5px -143px; } .flags-london { height: 147px; background-position: -5px -288px; } What is the z-index in CSS? The z-index helps to specify the stack order of positioned elements that may overlap one another.\nHigher the z-index of an element means,\n higher stack order, more visibility, cover elements with smaller z-index if overlapping.  CSS Syntax z-index: auto | number | initial | inherit Property Values  auto: Sets the stack order equal to its parents. This is default. number: Can have zero, positive or negative number. Higher the number, higher stack order. initial: Sets this property to its default value. inherit: Inherits this property from its parent element.

These questions verifies your theoretical as well as practical knowledge about JavaScript. Keep following this post for regular updates.\nQ1. What is Closure in JavaScript?   Definition: A closure is an inner function having access to its outer function scope and all above scopes even when that function is executing outside of its outer function.\n  When you define an inner function inside outer function, a closure is created at runtime for inner function bundled with outer function\u0026rsquo;s scope. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the example to understand Closures\nvar outerFunc = function(c){ var a = 1; var innerFunc = function(d) { var b = 2; var innerMostFunc = function(e) { return a + b + c + d + e; } return innerMostFunc; } return innerFunc; } console.dir(outerFunc(3)); //1. innerFunc console.dir(outerFunc(3)(4)); //2. innerMostFunc console.log(outerFunc(3)(4)(5)); //3. 15 Output ▼ ƒ innerFunc(c) length: 1 name: \u0026quot;innerFunc\u0026quot; arguments: null caller: null ➤ prototype: {constructor: ƒ} ➤ __proto__: ƒ () [[FunctionLocation]]: ▼ [[Scopes]]: Scopes[2] ➤ 0: Closure (outerFunc) {c: 3, a: 1} ➤ 1: Global {parent: Window, opener: null, top: Window, length: 1, frames: Window, …} ▼ ƒ innerMostFunc(c) length: 1 name: \u0026quot;innerMostFunc\u0026quot; arguments: null caller: null ➤ prototype: {constructor: ƒ} ➤ __proto__: ƒ () [[FunctionLocation]]: ▼ [[Scopes]]: Scopes[3] ➤ 0: Closure (innerFunc) {d: 4, b: 2} ➤ 1: Closure (outerFunc) {c: 3, a: 1} ➤ 2: Global {parent: Window, opener: null, top: Window, length: 1, frames: Window, …} 15 We have three console dir/log. Let\u0026rsquo;s discuss them one by one:\n  innerFunc has a closure of variables defined or passed as argument in outerFunc\n 0: Closure (outerFunc) {c: 3, a: 1}    innerMostFunc has a closure of variables defined or passed as argument in in outerFunc and innerFunc i.e.\n 0: Closure (innerFunc) {d: 4, b: 2} 1: Closure (outerFunc) {c: 3, a: 1}    innerMostFunc returns a+b+c+d+e=15 where\n value of a and c is coming from Closure (outerFunc) value of b and d is coming from Closure (innerFunc) value of e is coming from passed argument      Q2. What are Promises and why do we use it?   Promises are introduced natively in ES6. They are very similar to our promises. As we keep or break the promise, Javascript promises are either resolve or reject.\n  In earlier days, you would have used callbacks to handle asynchronous operations. However, callbacks have limited functionality and often leads to unmanageable code if you are handling multiple async calls also known as callback hell. Promises were introduced to improve code readability and better handling of async calls and errors.\n  Syntax of simple promise object.\nlet promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) { // asynchronous call });    Also read this post for more details on promises in javascript\n Q3. How to use async and await and what problem does it solve?   Async/Await introduced in ECMAScript2017 is a new way to handle asynchronous operation. Its underlying is Promise with improved syntax to write concise, readable and easy to debug code as compare to promises and callbacks.\n  When Async keyword is applied before a function, it turns into asynchronous function and always return a promise object.\n  await keyword works only inside async function and it makes the function execution wait until the returned promise settles (either resolve or reject).\n  Usage of async/await:\n1async function hello() { 2 let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =\u0026gt; { 3 setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; resolve(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;), 5000) 4 }); 5 6 let value = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves 7 8 return value; 9} 10 11hello().then(data =\u0026gt; console.log(data)); Please note that in above code snippet when we execute async function hello(), function execution literally waits for 5s at line 6 before returning resolved promise object. CPU resources are not utilized in this wait period and can be used for other work.\n   Also read this post for more details on async/await in javascript\n Q4. What is a difference between call, apply and bind in JavaScript?  All three call, apply and bind are prototype methods of Function that means you can execute these three methods on any function. All three call, apply and bind methods are used to execute the function in explicit context where this refers to the first argument passed in method. call() - accepts the function arguments as comma separated values arg1, arg2, \u0026hellip; functionName.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)  apply() - accepts the function arguments as array of values [arg1, arg2, \u0026hellip;] functionName.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2, ...])  bind() - returns a new bounded function which can be executed later. functionName.bind(thisArg)  call() and apply() methods are executed immediately whereas bind() method return a new bounded function which can be executed later.   Also read this post for more details on difference between call, bind and apply with their practical usage\n Q5. What is Arrow function and how it is different from normal functions?  Arrow functions are introduced in ES6 and allow us to write shorter function syntax. var helloES5 = function() { return \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;; } var helloES6 = () =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;Hello World\u0026#34;;  In normal function this keyword represents the object that called the function but in arrow function this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.  Q6. What is a difference between == and === operator?  == is abstract comparison operator which only compares the content and not its type  1 == 1 // true, content and its type is same '1' == 1 // true, auto type conversion, string converted into number null == undefined // true, because null is equivalent of undefined 0 == false // true, because false is equivalent of 0 \u0026quot;\u0026quot; == false // true, because false is equivalent of empty string  === is strict comparison operator which compare both content and its type  1 === 1 true '1' === 1 false null === undefined false 0 === false false \u0026quot;\u0026quot; === false false  === is faster then == because == converts the operands to the compatible type before comparison whereas === compares directly without any conversion.   Also read this post for more details on == and === operators with many examples\n Q7. What is a difference between undefined and null ?  undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value yet. null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable that represents null, empty or non-existent value. undefined is type of undefined whereas null is an object. var a; console.log(typeof(a)); // undefined console.log(typeof(null)); // object   Q8. What is a difference between var, let and const keywords?  var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while var variables are initialized with undefined, let and const variables are not initialized. While var and let can be declared without being initialized, const must be initialized during declaration.   Also read this post for more details on difference between var, let and const\n Q9. What is variable Hoisting in JavaScript?   Hoisting is JavaScript\u0026rsquo;s default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).\n  Variables defined using var, let or const are all hoisted.\n  In hoisting process, var variable is initialized with undefined by default. If you try to access it before declaration then you will get undefined.\n  In hoisting process, let and const variables are not initialized. If you try to access them before declaration then you will get ReferenceError.\nconsole.log(x); // undefined console.log(y); // ReferenceError console.log(z); // ReferenceError  var x = 1; let y = 2; const z = 3;   Q10. What are the Object methods available in Javascript?  Object.create() method is used to create a new object with its prototype set to existing object. Object.assign() method is used to copy the properties and functions of one object in another object. Object.freeze() freezes the state of an Object once this method is called. It ignores if any existing property is modified, and if any new property is added. Object.seal() seals the state of an Object once this method is called. It allows the modification of existing properties, but ignores if any new property is added. Object.defineProperty() is used to define new property in existing object or modifying existing property. Property can be marked writable, configurable and enumerable. Object.is() is used to compare two values. Return true or false.   Also read this post for more details on Object methods with examples\n Q11. What is this keyword in Javascript? In JavaScript, this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. It has different values depending on where it is used:\n In a method, this refers to the owner object where method is defined. Alone, this refers to the global object. In a function, this refers to the global object. In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined. When a function called with new keyword, this refers to new object instance. In a DOM event, this refers to the element that received the event. Function prototype methods call(), apply() and bind() can be used to refer this to any object.   Also read this post to understand all about this keyword with examples\n Q12. What is the difference between throttle and debounce? Debounce and throttle are two similar (but different!) techniques to control how many times we allow a function to be executed over time.\n  Throttle If throttle interval is 100ms then a throttled function will be executed only once in 100ms, no matter how often you invoke that function.\nIf is useful for rate-limiting events that occur faster than you can keep up with. For e.g. update position at every 1s time interval in infinite scrolling.\nvar throttled = _.throttle(updatePosition, 100); $(window).scroll(throttled);   Debounce If debounce interval is 100ms then a debounced function will be executed after 100ms passed since its last execution.\nIt is mainly used to group a sudden burst of behavior and react afterwards. For e.g., recalculating a layout 1s after the window has stopped being resized, send event 2s after keystrokes has stopped on an input field, and so on.\nvar lazyLayout = _.debounce(calculateLayout, 300); $(window).resize(lazyLayout);    Underscore and Lodash libraries have built in function for both.\n Q13. What is constructor and prototype? Do you know about prototypal inheritance. We can define classes in JavaScript using function constructor.\n// ES5 Function Constructor var Person = function(firstName, lastName){ this.firstName = firstName; this.lastName = lastName; } We can add methods to our class using prototype.\nPerson.prototype = { getFullName(){ return `${this.firstName.toUpperCase()}${this.lastName.toUpperCase()}`; } } We can create a subclass Student of Person class using prototypal inheritance.\nvar Student = function(firstName, lastName, studentId){ Person.call(this, firstName, lastName); this.studentId = studentId; } Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype); Student.prototype.constructor = Student; We can further add methods in our subclass using prototype\nStudent.prototype.toString = function(){ return `Student {${this.lastName}${this.firstName}- ${this.studentId}}` } Let\u0026rsquo;s create an object from Student subclass\nvar student = new Student(\u0026#34;Ashish\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Lahoti\u0026#34;, 123456); console.log(student.getFullName()); // prints \u0026#39;ASHISH LAHOTI\u0026#39;  console.log(student.toString()); // prints \u0026#39;Student {Lahoti Ashish - 123456}\u0026#39; Q14. How do you define Class in ES6? We define class using class keyword in ES6 which is a replacement of function constructor.\n// ES6 Class class Car { constructor(brand, color, price) { this._brand = brand; this._color = color; this._price = price; } // getter method  get color(){ return `color is ${this._color.toUpperCase()}`; } // setter method  set color(newColor){ this._color = newColor; } // prototype method  drive(){ return `driving ${this._brand}${this._color}color car`; } // static method  static compareCars(car1, car2){ return `${car2._brand}is ${(car1._price \u0026gt; car2._price) ? \u0026#34;cheaper\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;costlier\u0026#34;}then ${car1._brand}` } } We can define getter, setter, prototype and static methods in classes. We can also create subclasses using extend keyword.\nclass Toyota extends Car { constructor(color, price, model, make){ super(\u0026#34;Toyota\u0026#34;, color, price); Object.assign(this, {model, make}); } }  Also read this post for more details on classes in JavaScript\n Q15.

CCOAK is mainly for devOps engineer focusing on build and manage Kafka cluster. CCDAK is mainly for developers and Solution architects focusing on design, producer and consumer. If you are still not sure, I recommend to go for CCDAK as it is more comprehensive exam as compared to CCOAK. These exam notes are very helpful for both CCDAK and CCOAK certifications.\nFrom here onward, we will talk about how to prepare for CCDAK.\nFrequently Asked Questions   Prepare well for the exam as it verifies your theoretical as well as practical understanding of Kafka. At least 40-50 hours of preparation is required. You can register online and schedule exam on the Examity site. I suggest to set a goal of 1 to 2 months for exam preparation and register accordingly. Confluent kafka certification price cost at $150 for one attempt. You need to pay the fee again in order to retake exam after a gap of at least 14 days. You need to answer 60 multiple-choice questions in 90 minutes from your laptop (with webcam) under the supervision of online proctor. There is no negative scoring so try to answer as many questions as possible. There is no mention of number of questions need to be correct in order to pass the exam. Result will be shown immediately (PASS or FAIL) at the end of exam. No scoring or percentage is provided. You will receive a certificate similar to my CCDAK certificate after passing the exam. What an achievement !!! The certification expires after two years but you can still brag about it ;) Don\u0026rsquo;t waste time searching for CCDAK Certification Dumps. There ain\u0026rsquo;t any. Confluent has launched FREE Fundamentals Accreditation Exam which you can signup for free to better understand the CCDAK exam.

You can expect most of the questions related to Kafka architecture from these notes. ☛ Moreover, If you are preparing for interviews then you can also expect most of the Kafka interview questions from these notes.\nCluster  Cluster typically consist of mutliple Kafka brokers. All Kafka brokers within a Cluster are managed and coordinated by Zookeeper.  Rack  Rack is a logical grouping of Kafka brokers within a Cluster. Cluster can have multiple racks. Rack can have multiple brokers. Broker belongs to a rack when property broker.rack=\u0026lt;rack-id\u0026gt; is specified at broker level. This enables the rack awareness feature which spreads replicas of the same partition across different racks. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you have 6 brokers and 2 racks. Brokers 1, 2, 3 are on the rack_1, and brokers 4, 5, 6 are on rack_2.\nNow when you create a topic with 6 partition, instead of assigning broker to partition in order from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, each partition is assigned to each rack repeatedly i.e. 1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6. ┌――――――――――――┐ ┌――――――――――――┐ | rack_1 | | rack_2 | |――――――――――――| |――――――――――――| | Broker 1 |◁― Partition 1 | Broker 4 |◁― Partition 2 | Broker 2 |◁― Partition 3 | Broker 5 |◁― Partition 4 | Broker 3 |◁― Partition 5 | Broker 6 |◁― Partition 6 └――――――――――――┘ └――――――――――――┘   Broker  Every broker in Kafka is a bootstrap server which knows about all brokers, topics and partitions (metadata) that means Kafka client (e.g. producer,consumer etc) only need to connect to one broker in order to connect to entire cluster. At all times, only one broker should be the controller, and one broker must always be the controller in the cluster  Topic  Kafka takes bytes as input without even loading them into memory (that\u0026rsquo;s called zero copy) Brokers have defaults for all the topic configuration parameters  Partition  Topic can have one or more partition. Each partition can have one or more replica decided by Replication Factor. Replication Factor = 3 means One leader partition and two replicas. It is not possible to delete a partition of topic once created. Order is guaranteed within the partition and once data is written into partition, its immutable! If producer writes at 1 GB/sec and consumer consumes at 250MB/sec then requires 4 partition!  Segment  Partitions are made of segments (*.log files) At a time only one segment is active in a partition Segment stores the actual Kafka messages along with offset, timestamp, compression etc. log.segment.bytes = 1 GB (default), Max size in bytes to close the segment and roll over to new segment. log.segment.ms = 1 Week (default), Max time in ms to wait before closing the segment even if it is not full or reached Max Size. Every segment also has two indexes (files):-  An offset to position index (*.index file) - Allows kafka where to read to find a message A timestamp to offset index (*.timeindex file) - Allows kafka to find a message with a timestamp    Log Retention and Cleanup policies  Log cleanup happen on partition segments (.log files). Smaller or more segments means the log cleanup will happen more often! Old segments are cleaned up based on time-based and size-based log retention policies whichever happens first. Time Based Retention: The segment older by configured retention time eligible for Cleanup. You can use any of the three configuration log.retention.ms, log.retention.minutes, or log.retention.hours to specify retention period in ms, minutes or hours. If ms is not set, minutes is used. If minutes is not set, hours is used. Default retention time is 1 Week. Size Based Retention: The older segment are cleaned up when the max configured size of a topic partition (includes all segments), is reached. You can use log.retention.bytes=-1 (default is infinite) to configure max size in bytes. Cleanup process checks any logs to cleanup in every log.cleaner.backoff.ms=15 seconds (default). Cleanup Policy: Logs are deleted, compacted, or both based on log.cleanup.policy. Delete policy discard the old segments when their retention time or size is reached. Compact policy delete the old messages per key and keep the latest copy for that key. Deleted records can still be seen by consumers for a period of delete.retention.ms=24 hours (default)  Offset  Each Topic Partition is having its own offset starting from 0.  Topic Replication  Replication factor = 3 and partition = 2 means there will be total 6 partition distributed across Kafka cluster. Each partition will be having 1 leader and 2 ISR (in-sync replica). Broker contains leader partition called leader of that partition and only leader can receive and serve data for partition. Replication factor can not be greater then number of broker in the kafka cluster. If topic is having a replication factor of 3 then each partition will live on 3 different brokers.  Producer  Kafka Producer automatically recover from following retriable errors:\nLEADER_NOT_AVAILABLE\nNOT_LEADER_FOR_PARTITION Kafka Producer throw error for following non-retriable errors:\nOFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE\nBROKER_NOT_AVAILABLE\nMESSAGE_TOO_LARGE\nINVALID_TOPIC_EXCEPTION If you send a message of size 3 MB to a topic with default message size configuration. Then producer will throw MessageSizeTooLarge exception immediately since it is not a retriable exception. When produce to a topic which doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist and auto.create.topic.enable=true then kafka creates the topic automatically with the broker/topic settings num.partition and default.replication.factor  Producer Acknowledgment    acks Producer\u0026hellip; Data Loss     acks=0 do not wait for acknowledgement possible data loss   acks=1 wait for leader acknowledgement limited data loss   acks=all wait for leader+replica acknowledgement no data loss    acks=all must be used in conjunction with min.insync.replicas which can be set at broker or topic level.\n*( assuming that replicas are distributed across 3 brokers for below points )\n min.insync.replica only matters if acks=all acks=all, min.insync.replica=2 implies that at least 2 brokers that are ISR (including leader) must acknowledge acks=all, min.insync.replica=1 implies that at least 1 brokers that is ISR (including leader) must acknowledge A kafka topic with replication.factor=3, acks=all, min.insync.replicas=2 can only tolerate 1 broker going down, otherwise the producer will receive an exception NOT_ENOUGH_REPLICAS on send. A kafka topic with replication.factor=3, acks=all, min.insync.replicas=1, can tolerate maximum number of 2 brokers going down, so that a producer can still produce to the topic.  Producer Configuration  Mandatory properties to configure Kafka producer is as follows:\nbootstrap.servers\nkey.serializer\nvalue.serializer  Safe Producer Configuration  min.insync.replicas=2 (set at broker or topic level) retries=MAX_INT number of reties by producer in case of transient failure/exception. (default is 0) max.in.flight.per.connection number=5 number of producer request can be made in parallel (default is 5) acks=all enable.idempotence=true producer send producerId with each message to identify for duplicate msg at kafka end. When kafka receives duplicate message with same producerId which it already committed. It do not commit it again and send ack to producer (default is false)  High Throughput Producer using compression and batching  compression.type=snappy value can be none(default), gzip, lz4, snappy. Compression is enabled at the producer level and doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any config change in broker or consumer Compression is more effective in case of bigger batch of messages being sent to kafka linger.ms=20 Number of millisecond a producer is willing to wait before sending a batch out. (default 0). Increase linger.ms value increase the chance of batching. batch.size=32KB or 64KB Maximum number of bytes that will be included in a batch (default 16KB). Any message bigger than the batch size will not be batched  Message Key  Producer can choose to send a key with message. If key = null, data is send in round robin If key is sent, then all message for that key will always go to same partition. This can be used to order the messages for a specific key since order is guaranteed in same partition. Adding a partition to the topic will loose the guarantee of same key go to same partition. Keys are hashed using murmur2 algorithm by default.  Message Size  Default Message max size is 1MB If you try to send message \u0026gt; 1MB then MessageSizeTooLargeException is thrown Suppose you want to send a 15MB of message from producer to broker to consumer successfully then you need to configure:-  message.max.bytes=15728640 (broker/topic config) - is max size of message that can be received by the broker from producer. replica.fetch.max.bytes=15728640 (broker config) - is max size of message that can be replicated across brokers. fetch.message.max.bytes=15728640 (consumer config) - is max size of message that can be fetched by consumer.    Consumer  Per thread one consumer is the rule. Consumer must not be multi threaded. Each consumer is assigned to different partition in same consumer group.  If there are 5 consumers of same consumer group consuming from a topic with 10 partition then 2 partitions will be assigned to each consumer and no consumer will remain idle. If there are 10 consumers of same consumer group consuming from a topic with 5 partition then 5 partition will be assigned to 5 consumers and rest 5 consumers will remain idle.   records-lag-max (monitoring metrics) The maximum lag in terms of number of records for any partition in this window. An increasing value over time is your best indication that the consumer group is not keeping up with the producers.  Consumer Group  If two applications want to process all the messages independently from a kafka topic having 4 partition, then you should create 2 consumer groups with 4 consumers in each group for optimal performance.  Consumer Offset When consumer in a group has processed the data received from Kafka, it commits the offset in Kafka topic named _consumer_offset which is used when a consumer dies, it will be able to read back from where it left off.\nDelivery Semantics  At most once Offset are committed as soon as message batch is received. If the processing goes wrong, the message will be lost (it won\u0026rsquo;t be read again) At least once (default) Offset are committed after the message is processed. If the processing goes wrong, the message will be read again. This can result in duplicate processing of message.  Make sure your processing is idempotent. (i.e. re-processing the message won\u0026rsquo;t impact your systems). For most of the application, we use this and ensure processing are idempotent.   Exactly once Can only be achieved for Kafka=\u0026gt;Kafka workflows using Kafka Streams API. For Kafka=\u0026gt;Sink workflows, use an idempotent consumer.  Consumer Offset commit strategy  enable.auto.commit=true \u0026amp; synchronous processing of batches with auto commit, offset will be committed automatically for you at regular interval (auto.commit.interval.ms=5000 by default) every time you call .poll(). If you don\u0026rsquo;t use synchronous processing, you will be in \u0026ldquo;at most once\u0026rdquo; behavior because offsets will be committed before your data is processed. enable.auto.commit=false \u0026amp; manual commit of offsets (recommended)  Consumer Offset reset behavior  auto.offset.reset=latest will read from the end of the log auto.offset.reset=earliest will read from the start of the log auto.offset.reset=none will throw exception of no offset is found Consumer offset can be lost if hasn\u0026rsquo;t read new data in 7 days. This can be controlled by broker setting offset.retention.minutes  Consumer Poll Behavior  fetch.min.bytes = 1 (default), Control how much data you want to pull at least on each request. Help improving throughput and decreasing request number. At the cost of latency. max.poll.records = 500 (default), Controls how many records to receive per poll request. Increase if your messages are very small and have a lot of available RAM. max.partition.fetch.bytes = 1MB (default), Maximum data returned by broker per partition. If you read from 100 partition, you will need a lot of memory (RAM) fetch.max.bytes = 50MB (default), Maximum data returned for each fetch request (covers multiple partition). Consumer performs multiple fetches in parallel.  Consumer Heartbeat Thread  Heartbeat mechanism is used to detect if consumer application in dead. session.timeout.ms=10s (default), If heartbeat is not sent in 10 second period, the consumer is considered dead. Set lower value to faster consumer rebalances heartbeat.interval.ms=3s (default), Heartbeat is sent in every 3 seconds interval. Usually 1/3rd of session.timeout.ms  Consumer Poll Thread  Poll mechanism is also used to detect if consumer application is dead. max.poll.interval.ms = 5min (default), Max amount of time between two .poll() calls before declaring consumer dead. If processing of message batch takes more time in general in application then should increase the interval.  Kafka Guarantees  Messages are appended to a topic-partition in the order they are sent Consumer read the messages in the order stored in topic-partition With a replication factor of N, producers and consumers can tolerate upto N-1 brokers being down As long as number of partitions remains constant for a topic ( no new partition), the same key will always go to same partition  Client Bi-Directional Compatibility  an Older client (1.1) can talk to Newer broker (2.0) a Newer client (2.0) can talk to Older broker (1.1)  Kafka Connect  Source connect Get data from common data source to Kafka for e.g. import data from external database to kafka Sink connect Publish data from Kafka to common data source for e.g. export data from Kafka to external database  Zookeeper   ZooKeeper servers will be deployed on multiple nodes. This is called an ensemble. An ensemble is a set of 2n + 1 ZooKeeper servers where n is any number greater than 0. The odd number of servers allows ZooKeeper to perform majority elections for leadership. At any given time, there can be up to n failed servers in an ensemble and the ZooKeeper cluster will keep quorum. If at any time, quorum is lost, the ZooKeeper cluster will go down.\n  Zookeeper cluster to withstand loss of 2 server, require total of 2*2+1 = 5 servers.\n  In Zookeeper multi-node configuration, initLimit and syncLimit are used to govern how long following ZooKeeper servers can take to initialize with the current leader and how long they can be out of sync with the leader. If tickTime=2000, initLimit=5 and syncLimit=2 then a follower can take (tickTimeinitLimit) = 10000ms to initialize and may be out of sync for up to (tickTimesyncLimit) = 4000ms\n  In Zookeeper multi-node configuration, The server.* properties set the ensemble membership. The format is\nserver.\u0026lt;myid\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;hostname\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;leaderport\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;electionport\u0026gt;, where:\n myid is the server identification number. In this example, there are three servers, so each one will have a different myid with values 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The myid is set by creating a file named myid in the dataDir that contains a single integer in human readable ASCII text. This value must match one of the myid values from the configuration file. If another ensemble member has already been started with a conflicting myid value, an error will be thrown upon startup. leaderport is used by followers to connect to the active leader. This port should be open between all ZooKeeper ensemble members. electionport is used to perform leader elections between ensemble members. This port should be open between all ZooKeeper ensemble members.

Confluent Schema Notes  Schema Registry stores all schemas in a Kafka topic _schemas defined by kafkastore.config = _schemas (default) which is a single partition topic with log compacted. The default response media type application/vnd.schemaregistry.v1+json, application/vnd.schemaregistry+json, application/json are used in response header. HTTP and HTTPS client protocol are supported for schema registry. Prefix to apply to metric names for the default JMX reporter kafka.schema.registry Default port for listener is 8081 Confluent support primitive types of null, Boolean, Integer, Long, Float, Double, String, byte[], and complex type of IndexedRecord. Sending data of other types to KafkaAvroSerializer will cause a SerializationException  \n3. Confluent Schema Compatibility Types BACKWARD  Consumer using schema X can process data produced with schema X or X-1. In case of BACKWARD_TRANSITIVE, consumer using schema X can process data produced with all previous schema X, X-1, X-2 and so on Delete field without default value (Required field) is allowed. In this case, Consumer ignore this field. Add field with default value (Optional field) is allowed. In this case, Consumer will assign default value. BACKWARD is default compatibility type in confluent schema registry. There is no assurance that consumers using older schema can read data produced using the new schema. Therefore, upgrade all consumers before you start producing new events.  FORWARD  Data produced using schema X can be ready by consumers with schema X or X-1. In case of FORWARD_TRANSITIVE, data produced using schema X can be ready by consumers with all previous schema X, X-1, X-2 and so on Add field without default value (Required field) is allowed. In this case, Consumer ignore this field. Delete field with default value (Optional field) is allowed. In this case, Consumer will assign default value. There is no assurance that consumers using the new schema can read data produced using older schema. Therefore, first upgrade all producers to using the new schema and make sure the data already produced using the older schema are not available to consumers, then upgrade the consumers.  FULL  Backward and forward compatible between schema X and X-1. In case of FULL_TRANSITIVE, backward and forward compatible between all previous schema X and X-1 and X-2 and so on Modify field with default value (Optional field) is allowed. There are assurances that consumers using older schema can read data produced using the new schema and that consumers using the new schema can read data produced using older schema. Therefore, you can upgrade the producers and consumers independently.  NONE  Compatibility type means schema compatibility checks are disabled. Upgrading Consumer or Producer depends. For example, modifying a field type from Number to String. In this case, you will either need to upgrade all producers and consumers to the new schema version at the same time  Default Ports   Zookeeper Client Port: 2181 Zookeeper Leader Port: 3888 Zookeeper Election Port (Peer port): 2888 Broker: 9092 REST Proxy: 8082 Schema Registry: 8081 KSQL: 8088 ","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/post/apache-kafka-ccdak-exam-notes/","tags":["Confluent Kafka CCDAK","Popular Posts"],"title":"Apache Kafka CCDAK Exam Notes"},{"categories":["Javascript"],"contents":"This post explains the DOM, Virtual DOM and Shadow DOM concepts and their differences\u0026hellip;\nDOM DOM in shorthand for Document Object Model - It’s a way of representing a structured content via objects. HTML, XHTML, XML are some of the ways to write structured content.\nWhen browser renders an HTML page, it sort of compiles this HTML behind the scene and generates a DOM Object. This DOM Object can be accessed and manipulated by JavaScript and CSS for e.g. when you click on a button, a DOM click event is triggered which JavaScript can listen and manipulate DOM to show a pop up dialog.\nBy default, when there is any change in the DOM Object, browser re-render the whole page. In this way changes in DOM are expensive in terms of performance.\nTo solve this issue, new concepts came out. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at them:-\nVirtual DOM  The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM. Popular UI frameworks React.js and Vue.js, both use Virtual DOM. The concept of virtual DOM is mainly to solve performance issue, Here is how:-   Any update in the DOM first applied to Virtual DOM instead of applying directly to actual DOM. Then it compare the changes against actual DOM through a process call diffing and apply the changes efficiently to actual DOM by only re-rendering the changed elements. In additional to that, It allows to collect several changes to be applied at once, so not every single change causes a re-render, but instead re-rendering only happens once after a set of changes were applied from virtual DOM to actual DOM  Shadow DOM  You can think of the shadow DOM as a DOM within a DOM. A real DOM can have many shadow DOMs but each share DOM has its own isolated DOM tree with its own elements and styles, completely isolated from the real DOM. Concept of Shadow DOM is natively supported by most of the browsers including Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari. You can make reusable native web components which follows Shadow DOM concept. Implementation and styling of native web component is hidden within the Shadow DOM and having no impact from the outer DOM. Polymer LitElement and Vaadin provides open source reusable web components built using shadow DOM concept.  Shadow DOM is not a new concept Although only recently specified for use by web authors, the shadow DOM has been used by user agents for years to create and style complex components such as form elements. Let’s take the range input element, for example. To create one on the page, all we have to do is add the following element:\n\u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;range\u0026#34;\u0026gt; That one element results in the following component:\n  If we dig deeper, we will see that this one \u0026lt;input\u0026gt; element is actually made up of several smaller \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; elements, controlling the track and the slider itself.\n This is achieved using the shadow DOM. The element that is exposed to the host HTML document the simple \u0026lt;input\u0026gt;, but underneath it there are elements and styles related to the component that do not form part of the DOM’s global scope.\n","permalink":"https://codingnconcepts.com/javascript/virtual-dom-vs-shadow-dom/","tags":["Javascript Interview","Javascript Core"],"title":"Virtual Dom vs Shadow Dom"},{"categories":["Java","Kafka"],"contents":"Implementation of Kafka Consumer using Java\nppackage com.abc;

We will also look at rules to create immutable classes and eventually we\u0026rsquo;ll write an Immutable Class from scratch in Java.\nWhat is Immutable Class? Immutable Class means that once an object is initialized from this Class, we cannot change the state of that object.\nIn other words, An immutable object can’t be modified after it has been created. When a new value is needed, the accepted practice is to make a copy of the object that has the new value.\nExamples In Java, All primitive wrapper classes (Integer, Byte, Long, Float, Double, Character, Boolean and Short) and String are immutable in nature.\nString is the most popular Immutable Class known among developers. String object cannot be modified once initialized. Operations like trim(), substring(), replace(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase() always return a new instance and don’t affect the current instance.\nIn the below example, s1.toUpperCase() returns new instance which need to assign back to s1, if you want s1 to refer to new uppercase instance.\nString s1 = new String(\u0026#34;CodingNConcepts\u0026#34;); String s2 = s1.toUpperCase(); System.out.println(s1 == s2); //false s1 = s2; //assign back to s1 System.out.println(s1 == s2); //true Benefits of Immutable Class Some of the key benefits of Immutable Class are:-\n1. Mutable vs Immutable Object A mutable object starts with one state (initial values of the instance variables). Each mutation of the instance variable takes the object to another state. This brings in the need to document all possible states a mutable object can be in. It is also difficult to avoid inconsistent or invalid states. Hence, all these makes a mutable object difficult to work with.\nWhereas, immutable object have just one state, which is first and foremost benefit of Immutable Class.\n2. Thread safety Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe. They do not require synchronization. Since there is no way the state of an immutable object can change, there is no possibility of one thread observing the effect of another thread. We do not have to deal with the intricacies of sharing an object among threads (like locking, synchronization, making variables volatile etc.). Thus, we can freely share immutable objects. This is the easiest way to achieve thread safety.\n3. Reusable/Cacheable Immutable objects encourage to cache or store the frequently used instances rather than creating one each time. This is because two immutable instances with the same properties/values are equal.\nSome examples of this being applied are as follows:-\nPrimitive wrapper classes\nCreating primitive wrapper objects (Integer, Float, Double etc) using static factory method valueOf does not always return new wrapper instances. In case of Integer, they cache Integer values from -128 to 127 by default.\nInteger oneV1 = new Integer(1); Integer oneV2 = new Integer(1); System.out.println(oneV1 == oneV2); //false System.out.println(oneV1.equals(oneV2)); //true  oneV1 = Integer.valueOf(1); //returns cached instance oneV2 = Integer.valueOf(1); //returns cached instance System.out.println(oneV1 == oneV2); //true System.out.println(oneV1.equals(oneV2)); //true BigInteger\nBigInteger stores some common BigInteger values as instance variables.\n/** * The BigInteger constant zero. */ public static final BigInteger ZERO = new BigInteger(new int[0], 0); This reduces the memory footprint and the garbage collection costs.\n4. Building blocks for Collections The immutable objects make a great building block for Collections as compare to mutable objects. Let\u0026rsquo;s understand the problem we face with mutable objects in Collections.\nFirst of all, we create a mutable Person class\nclass Person { String name; public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } @Override public String toString() { return \u0026#34;Person { name: \u0026#34; + name + \u0026#34; }\u0026#34;; } } Now let\u0026rsquo;s create some person objects to create Set of persons:-\nPerson person1 = new Person(); person1.setName(\u0026#34;Adam\u0026#34;); Person person2 = new Person(); person2.setName(\u0026#34;Ben\u0026#34;); Set\u0026lt;Person\u0026gt; setOfPerson = new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(Arrays.asList(person1, person2)); System.out.println(setOfPerson); person1.setName(\u0026#34;Charlie\u0026#34;); System.out.println(setOfPerson); Output [Person { name: Adam }, Person { name: Ben }] [Person { name: Charlie }, Person { name: Ben }] We wanted to create a Set of persons Adam and Ben but next part of the code has mutated the Adam to Charlie which is not intended. We will solve this problem by making an immutable class ImmutablePerson in subsequent part of the article.\nAs we saw that mutable objects can be mutated even if not intended, immutable objects make a great fit to be used as Keys of a Map, in Set, List, and other collections.\nHow to create Immutable Class? In order to create an Immutable Class, you should keep following points in mind:-\n Declare the class as final so that it cannot be extended and subclasses will not be able to override methods. Make all the fields as private so direct access in not allowed Make all the fields as final so that value cannot be modified once initialized Provide no setter methods — setter methods are those methods which modify fields or objects referred to by fields. Initialize all the final fields through a constructor and perform a deep copy for mutable objects. If the class holds a mutable object:  Don\u0026rsquo;t provide any methods that modify the mutable objects. Always return a copy of mutable object from getter method and never return the actual object reference.    Let\u0026rsquo;s apply all the above points and create our immutable class ImmutablePerson\nImmutablePerson.java /** * Immutable class should mark as final so it can not be extended. * Fields should mark as private so direct access is not allowed. * Fields should mark as final so value can not be modified once initialized. **/ public final class ImmutablePerson { // String - immutable  private final String name; // Integer - immutable  private final Integer weight; // Date - mutable  private final Date dateOfBirth; /** * All the final fields are initialized through constructor * Perform a deep copy of immutable objects */ public ImmutablePerson(String name, Integer weight, Date dateOfBirth){ this.name = name; this.weight = weight; this.dateOfBirth = new Date(dateOfBirth.getTime()); } /********************************************** ***********PROVIDE NO SETTER METHODS ********* **********************************************/ /** * String class is immutable so we can return the instance variable as it is **/ public String getName() { return name; } /** * Integer class is immutable so we can return the instance variable as it is **/ public Integer getWeight() { return weight; } /** * Date class is mutable so we need a little care here. * We should not return the reference of original instance variable. * Instead a new Date object, with content copied to it, should be returned. **/ public Date getDateOfBirth() { return new Date(dateOfBirth.getTime()); } @Override public String toString() { return \u0026#34;Person { name: \u0026#34; + name + \u0026#34;, weight: \u0026#34; + weight + \u0026#34;, dateOfBirth: \u0026#34; + new SimpleDateFormat(\u0026#34;dd-MM-yyyy\u0026#34;).format(dateOfBirth) + \u0026#34;}\u0026#34;; } } Now, Let\u0026rsquo;s create immutable person objects to create Set of persons:-\nImmutablePerson person1 = new ImmutablePerson(\u0026#34;Adam\u0026#34;, 55, new SimpleDateFormat(\u0026#34;dd-MM-yyyy\u0026#34;).parse(\u0026#34;01-01-2001\u0026#34;)); ImmutablePerson person2 = new ImmutablePerson(\u0026#34;Ben\u0026#34;, 50, new SimpleDateFormat(\u0026#34;dd-MM-yyyy\u0026#34;).parse(\u0026#34;02-02-2002\u0026#34;)); Set\u0026lt;ImmutablePerson\u0026gt; setOfPerson = new HashSet\u0026lt;\u0026gt;(Arrays.asList(person1, person2)); System.out.println(setOfPerson); /** * ImmutablePerson do not provide setter methods, * no way to mutate name, weight, or date property fields. */ //person1.setName(\u0026#34;Charlie\u0026#34;); //person1.setWeight(90); //person1.setDate(new SimpleDateFormat(\u0026#34;dd-MM-yyyy\u0026#34;).parse(\u0026#34;03-03-2003\u0026#34;));  /** * getDateOfBirth() method returns new instance of date, * setYear() will not change value of person1\u0026#39;s date field. */ Date person1Date = person1.getDateOfBirth(); person1Date.setYear(2020); System.out.println(setOfPerson); Output [Person { name: Adam, weight: 55, dateOfBirth: 01-01-2001}, Person { name: Ben, weight: 50, dateOfBirth: 02-02-2002}] [Person { name: Adam, weight: 55, dateOfBirth: 01-01-2001}, Person { name: Ben, weight: 50, dateOfBirth: 02-02-2002}] We see that we can not mutate the collection of ImmutablePerson once created.\nSummary In this tutorial, we learned about Immutable Class in Java and its benefits. Moreover, Immutable Class is frequently asked interview question to check your understanding on design pattern, immutable \u0026amp; mutable objects and final keyword.\nWhat do you think?  As per Oracle Docs for Immutable Classes, Don\u0026rsquo;t allow subclasses to override methods. The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as final. A more sophisticated approach is to make the constructor private and construct instances in factory methods.\n Please note that we have marked the class as final and constructor as public in our ImmutablePerson class.\nIt is debatable. Should we use private constructor with static factory method to create instances? My view is we are restricting the instance creation by using private constructor, which is not a desired scenario for immutability.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s your thoughts on this?

You have only 3 chances to weigh the balls in any combination using the scales. Determine which ball is the odd one and if it’s heavier or lighter than the rest. How do you do it?\nSolution First of all we will give a number to each ball i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12\nThe trick to solve these kind of weight problem is to divide them in groups. We will divide these 12 balls in 3 groups:\n   Group Ball Numbers     group 1 1, 2, 3, 4   group 2 5, 6, 7, 8   group 3 9, 10, 11, 12    Now we keep the group 3 aside and put group 1 balls on one side of scale and group 2 balls on another side of scale [1] with three possible outcomes:-\n1. Scale is balanced That means each ball in group 1 and group 2 are identical in weight and defective one is from group 3.\nWe know that defective one if from group 3 but we don\u0026rsquo;t know that defective one is lighter or heavier as compare to others. To solve this we need to weigh some balls from group 3 against some balls from either group 1 or group 2\nLet\u0026rsquo;s weight group 3 (9, 10, 11) vs group 2 (6, 7, 8) with three possible outcomes:-\n If group 3 (9, 10, 11) and group 2 (6, 7, 8) balances, then 12 is the odd ball. Weigh it against any other ball to determine if heavy or light. If group 3 (9, 10, 11) is heavy then they contain a heavy ball. Weigh 9 vs 10, if balanced then 11 is the odd heavy ball, else the heavier of 9 or 10 is the odd heavy ball. If group 3 (9, 10, 11) is light then they contain a light ball. Weigh 9 vs 10, if balanced then 11 is the odd light ball, else the lighter of 9 or 10 is the odd light ball.  2. group 1 is heavier then group 2 That means either group 1 (heavy ball) or group 2 (light ball) contains the defective ball and group 3 has all good balls.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s weigh 5,6,1 vs 7,2,12 with 3 possible outcomes:-\n If 5,6,1 vs 7,2,12 balances, then either 8 is the odd light ball or 3 or 4 is the odd heavy ball. Weigh 3 vs 4, if they balance then 8 is the odd light ball, or the heaviest of 3 vs 4 is the odd heavy ball. If 7,2,12 is heavy then either 2 is the odd heavy ball or 5 or 6 is the odd light ball. Weigh 5 vs 6, if balanced then 2 is the odd heavy ball, or the lightest of 5 vs 6 is the odd light ball. If 7,2,12 is light then either 7 is light or 1 is heavy. Weigh 7 against any other ball, if balanced then 1 is the odd heavy ball else 7 is the odd light ball.  3. group 2 is heavier then group 1 That means either group 2 (heavy ball) or group 1 (light ball) contains the defective ball and group 3 has all good balls.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s weigh 1,2,5 vs 3,6,12 with 3 possible outcomes:-\n If 1,2,5 vs 3,6,12 balances, then either 4 is the odd light ball or 7 or 8 is the odd heavy ball. Weigh 7 vs 8, if they balance then 4 is the odd light ball, or the heaviest of 7 vs 8 is the odd heavy ball. If 3,6,12 is heavy then either 6 is the odd heavy ball or 1 or 2 is the odd light ball. Weigh 1 vs 2, if balanced then 6 is the odd heavy ball, or the lightest of 1 vs 2 is the odd light ball. If 3,6,12 is light then either 3 is light or 5 is heavy. Weigh 3 against any other ball, if balanced then 5 is the odd heavy ball else 3 is the odd light ball.
