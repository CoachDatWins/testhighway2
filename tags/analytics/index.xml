      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 baskets. One basket has apples only, one has oranges only and the other has mixture of apples and oranges. All the three baskets have wrong labels on it that means if basket is labelled as ORANGES, it is having either mixture or apples. You have to pick only one fruit from any of the one basket and correctly label all the three baskets. How do you do it?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This particular problem has been asked several times in interviews to evaluate candidate&amp;rsquo;s analytical skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a light bulb inside a closed room (no windows) with one door. You cannot see the light bulb is on or off as the door is closed. However, you can assume that the light is off initially. There are three light switches outside the room. One of the switch belongs to the light bulb inside the room. You can turn on or off the switches however you want, but you are allowed to open the door only once. You are not allowed to touch the switches once you open the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you figure out which switch belongs to the light?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 25 Horses Puzzle is a famous Google interview question that has been asked in many companies to evaluate candidate&amp;rsquo;s analytical ability and problem solving approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have 25 horses and you need to identify the fastest 3 horses out of those 25. Only 5 horses can run in each race at the same time as there are only 5 tracks. What is the minimum number of races required to identify the fastest 3 horses without using a stopwatch or timer?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two ropes of varying thickness and length. Each rope burns in exactly 60 minutes. How can you measure 45 mins using only these two ropes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; You can’t cut the rope in half because of varying thickness and you don&amp;rsquo;t have a timer or watch to measure the burning time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The legend says that this problem was created by Albert Einstein in the last century. Einstein said that only 2% of the world could solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no tricks, just pure logic, so good luck and don’t give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a street there are five houses, painted five different colors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In each house lives a man of different nationality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These five homeowners each drink a different kind of beverage, smoke different brand of cigar and keep a different pet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who owns the fish?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
