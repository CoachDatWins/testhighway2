It is a shorthand syntax for lambda expression that executes one method. You can write more compact and readable code using double colon operator as compare to anonymous classes and lambda expression. We are going to understand its usage with lots of examples.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Streams in Java 8</title><link>https://codingnconcepts.com/java/streams-in-java-8/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://codingnconcepts.com/java/streams-in-java-8/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the major feature of Java 8 is addition of Stream. It also has introduced the functional programming in Java. We will discuss different stream operations available in Collection, Array, IntStream with examples. We will also discuss the difference between Intermediate and Terminal operations.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
