			<p>These Microservices based interview questions are based on my personal interview experience and feedback from other interviewees. Keep following this post for regular updates.</p>
<h4 id="1-what-do-you-understand-by-microservices">1. What do you understand by microservices?</h4>
<p>When you break an entire application architecture into smaller services where</p>
<ul>
<li>Each service is independently serves a functionality of that application</li>
<li>Each service has their own development, build process, deployment and testing cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of setup is known as microservices based architecture.<br>
<br /></p>
<h4 id="2-what-are-the-advantage-of-microservices-over-monolithic-application">2. What are the advantage of microservices over monolithic application?</h4>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Monolithic  application</th>
<th>Microservices based application</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Single code base for entire application so one small code change requires the build process, testing and deployment of entire application.</td>
<td>Each microservice can be <strong>developed, build, deployed and tested independently</strong> and code change in one microservice doesn&rsquo;t affect entire application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Single code base for entire application so can be written in one technology.</td>
<td>Each Microservice can be written in <strong>different technology stack</strong> like Java, Scala, Python, NodeJs etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monolithic application can be scaled vertically by adding more servers.</td>
<td>It can be <strong>scaled both vertically and horizontally</strong> by adding more servers and running multiple copies of each microservice behind a load balancer.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>If something goes wrong with monolithic application and its down means whole application is down.</td>
<td>It is <strong>fault tolerant</strong> and continue to run with limited functionality if something goes wrong in few microservices and they are down.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="3-you-have-to-migrate-an-existing-monolithic-application-to-microservices-what-will-be-your-approach">3. You have to migrate an existing monolithic application to microservices. What will be your approach?</h4>
<p>Migrating from monolithic application to microservices is a long term process where we gradually :-</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick one functionality of monolithic application</li>
<li>Copy the functionality from monolithic application in terms of source code, database, schema</li>
<li>Create an independent microservice which serves the same functionality</li>
<li>Integrate monolithic application with this microservice</li>
<li>Remove the source code, database, schema etc from monolithic application when integration with microservice is successful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat the above 5 steps until our entire monolithic application is converted into microservices.<br>
<br /></p>
<h4 id="4-what-are-the-best-practices-to-design-microservices-based-application-">4. What are the best practices to design microservices based application ?</h4>
<p>These are few best practices to design microservice:-</p>
<ul>
<li>One functionality one microservice</li>
<li>Separate data source for each microservice</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="5-what-are-the-challenges-in-microservices-based-application-">5. What are the challenges in microservices based application ?</h4>
<p>The challenges with microservices are as follows:-</p>
<ol>
<li>Require good investment for infrastructure setup.</li>
<li>It is a nightmare to manage development, build, test, deployment and release cycles manually. DevOps is must to implement CI/CD (Continuous integration, continuous delivery) automation.</li>
<li>Difficult to troubleshoot or debug an issue spanning across multiple microservices.</li>
<li>Overhead of inter communication between microservices</li>
<li>Challenges in development and testing where two or more microservices are involved.</li>
<li>Difficult to make configuration change across large fleet of microservices.</li>
<li>Operation and maintenance overhead.</li>
<li>Challenges comes with distributes system such as Network latency, fault tolerance, distributed transactions, unreliable networks, handling asynchronous operations.</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="6-how-do-you-troubleshoot-an-issue-using-logs-in-microservices-based-application-">6. How do you troubleshoot an issue using logs in microservices based application ?</h4>
<p>For troubleshooting an issue using logs in microservices based application,</p>
<ul>
<li>We should have a centralized logging system where each microservice push their logs to <code>Splunk</code> or <code>ELK (Elastic Logstash Kibana)</code> and we can use their built in dashboards to look at the logs for debugging.</li>
<li>We can generate a <strong>request_id</strong> for each external request, which is passed to all the microservices which are involved in handling the request. Include this <em>request_id</em> in all log messages pushed to <em>splunk</em> or <em>ELK</em>. We can troubleshoot any request end to end using this <em>request_id</em> if something goes wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="7-how-do-you-manage-configuration-in-microservices-based-application-">7. How do you manage configuration in microservices based application ?</h4>
<p>If we want to modify the configuration for a microservice that has been replicated a hundred times (one hundred processes are running). If the configuration for this microservice is packaged with the microservice itself, we’ll have to redeploy each of the one hundred instances. This can result in some instances using the old configuration, and some using the new one, at some point. Moreover, sometimes microservices use external connections which, for example, require URLs, usernames, and passwords. If you want to update these settings, it would be useful to have this configuration shared across services.</p>
<p>We use <strong>externalize configuration</strong> to solve this problem by keeping the configuration information in an external store such as github, database, filesystem, or environment variables or even a configuration server. At startup, microservices load the configuration from the external store or configuration server.</p>
<p><code>Netflix Archaius</code> and <code>Spring Cloud Config Server</code> provides ready made solution for externalize configuration.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="8-how-do-microservices-communicate-with-each-other-">8. How do microservices communicate with each other ?</h4>
<p>Microservices often communicate with each other using <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> over <strong>HTTP</strong>. The communication can be broadly divided into two categories:-</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RestTemplate</code>, <code>WebClient</code>, <code>FeignClient</code> can be used for <strong>synchronous communication</strong> between microservices</li>
<li><code>ActiveMQ</code>, <code>RabbitMQ</code>, <code>Kafka</code> can be used for <strong>asynchronous communication</strong> across microservices.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="9-what-is-service-discovery-pattern-in-microservices-">9. What is service discovery pattern in microservices ?</h4>
<p><strong>Service discovery</strong> is a pattern in microservices which solves the problem of service registry and discovery.</p>
<p>Service Discovery registers entries of all of the services running under that application. Whenever a service is up and running, it registers itself with discovery server and thereafter discovery server polls those services to check their heartbeats if they are up or down.</p>
<p>When one service (client) wants to make a request to another service, it can talk to discovery server to locate the service in two ways:-</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Client side service discovery</strong> Client asks the address of service from discovery server and then once client gets the address, it requests to the service directly.</p>
<p>Client <small>ask service_address ⟹</small> Discovery Server <small>give service_address ⟹</small> Client <small>make request ⟹</small> Service <small>return response ⟹</small> Client</p>
<p><code>Netflix Eureka</code> is one of the implementation of client side service discovery pattern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Server side service discovery</strong> Client request to discovery server which redirect the request to appropriate service and get the response back and redirect to client.</p>
<p>Client <small>make request ⟹</small> Discovery Server <small>redirect request ⟹</small> Service <small>return response ⟹</small>  Discovery Server <small>redirect response ⟹</small>  Client</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="10-what-is-circuit-breaker-pattern-in-microservices-">10. What is circuit breaker pattern in microservices ?</h4>
<p><strong>Circuit breaker</strong> is popular pattern for fault tolerance in microservices.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Services sometimes call other services to handle requests. There is always a possibility that the other service is unavailable or taking longer time to respond. Precious resources such as threads might be consumed in the caller service while waiting for the other service to respond. This might lead to resource exhaustion, which would make the calling service unable to handle other requests. The failure of one service can potentially cascade to other services throughout the application.</p>
<p>Thats where <strong>circuit breaker</strong> comes into play to prevent service failure from cascading to other services.</p>
<figure class="center">
    <img src="/img/interview/circuit-breaker-pattern.png"
         alt="Circuit Breaker"/> <figcaption>
            <p>Circuit Breaker</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Consider one service calling another service like an <em>electric circuit breaker</em>. When all works fine circuit breaker is <strong>closed</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When service detects that something is wrong with another service, the circuit breaks (circuit breaker is <strong>open</strong>).<br>
✦ <strong>When to break circuit?</strong><br>
✓ When m out of last n requests failed <em>(When 3 out of last 5 requests failed)</em><br>
✓ Request is considered failed if it responds after timeout period of t seconds <em>(say 2s)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once circuit breaks, service do not attempt to call another service.<br>
✦ <strong>What to do when circuit breaks?</strong><br>
● throw an error <em><strong>or</strong></em><br>
● return a fallback &ldquo;default&rdquo; response <em><strong>or</strong></em><br>
● save previous responses from cache</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After waiting for sleep window of x seconds <em>(say 10s)</em>, service attempts to call another service (circuit breaker is <strong>half open</strong>)<br>
● If request fails then circuit breaks (circuit breaker is open). It repeats step 2 and 3 again.<br>
● If gets a successful response back then circuit gets closed. Resume the requests again. All works fine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>Netflix Hystrix</code> is one of the implementation of circuit breaker pattern.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h4 id="11-what-is-api-gateway-pattern-in-microservices-">11. What is API gateway pattern in microservices ?</h4>
<p>API gateway pattern is a good approach to consider when building large or complex microservices based application.</p>
<figure class="center">
    <img src="/img/interview/api-gateway.png"
         alt="API Gateway"/> <figcaption>
            <p>API Gateway</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>API gateway provides a single entry point to access microservices and facilitate following features:-</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reverse proxy or gateway routing</strong> The API Gateway offers a reverse proxy to redirect or route HTTP requests to the endpoints of the internal microservices. The gateway provides a single endpoint or URL for the client apps and then internally maps the requests to a group of internal microservices. This routing feature helps to decouple the client apps from the microservices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request aggregation</strong> As part of the gateway pattern you can aggregate multiple client HTTP requests targeting multiple internal microservices into a single client request. This pattern is especially convenient when a client page/screen needs information from several microservices. With this approach, the client app sends a single request to the API Gateway that dispatches several requests to the internal microservices and then aggregates the results and sends everything back to the client app. The main benefit and goal of this design pattern is to reduce chattiness and round-trips between the client apps and the backend API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-cutting concerns or gateway offloading.</strong> Depending on the features offered by each API Gateway product, you can offload functionality from individual microservices to the gateway, which simplifies the implementation of each microservice by consolidating cross-cutting concerns into one tier. This is especially convenient for specialized features that can be complex to implement properly in every internal microservice, such as the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authentication &amp; Authorization</strong>  <br>
Authentication and Authorization is done at API gateway level and services do not need do further check.<br>
API gateway authenticates incoming request by evaluating OAuth token given by OAuth authentication server on successful authentication. This OAuth token can be used in subsequent requests.
After successful authentication API gateway authorize the request using access token (eg, send in custom HTTP header). Based on authorization, gateway route the request to services.</li>
<li><strong>Logging, debugging</strong> <br>
API gateway logs each incoming requests and outgoing response to centralized logging system where other microservices also push their logs. API gateway generates a <em>request_id</em> for each incoming request which is passed through all the microservices serving that request. Any request can be traced end to end using this <em>request_id</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Response Caching</strong><br>
API gateway can use caching mechanism for some of the request to provide response without routing request to underlying microservices.</li>
<li><strong>Load balancing</strong><br>
API gateway can load balance incoming request if multiple instances of same microservice is running.</li>
<li>Retry policies, circuit breaker
API gateway can provide a fault tolerant system by implementing retry policies and circuit breaker.</li>
<li><strong>IP whitelisting</strong><br>
Advantage of API gateway is that you need to provide only one IP for whitelisting when distributing APIs to thirdparty if required.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption</strong><br>
API gateway can provide encrypted communication to clients while underlying microservices communication remain unencrypted. API gateway decrypts the incoming request, route to microservices, encrypt the response and send to clients.</li>
<li><strong>SSL Certificate management</strong><br>
API gateway communication can be secured by providing SSL certificate to clients since API gateway is exposed whereas underlying microservices can communicate without SSL certification under a secure network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When you have multiple API gateways and each API gateway provide different API tailored for different clients app then this pattern is called <strong>Backend for Frontend (BFF)</strong> pattern.</p>

<h4 id="12-what-is-12-factor-app-">12. What is 12 Factor App ?</h4>
<p><a href="https://12factor.net/">The Twelve-Factor App</a> is a mythology for writing microservices having following factors:-</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Codebase</strong></mark><br>
<em>One codebase, multiple deploys.</em><br>
We should have only one repository for each microservice in our source control such as <code>git</code>, <code>subversion</code>. All the microservice deployment should be from that repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Dependencies</strong></mark><br>
<em>Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.</em><br>
We should use dependency manager in our microservice such as <code>maven (pom.xml)</code> or <code>gradle (build.gradle)</code> for <strong>Java</strong>.  Benefit is new developer can check out code onto their machine, requiring only language runtime and dependency manager as prerequisite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Config</strong></mark><br>
<em>Store config in the environment.</em><br>
We should create a <code>Spring Cloud Config Server</code> to manage configurations of all microservices across all environments like dev, staging, prod.<br>
We should not declare configuration inside source code because configuration varies across deployments but code does not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Backing services</strong></mark><br>
<em>Treat backing services as attached resources.</em><br>
We should integrate microservice with resources like datastores, messaging systems, caching system or other microservices from the configuration only. All the resource URL, locator, credentials should come from configuration no matter if it is a thirdparty resource or developed by your organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Build, Release &amp; Run</strong></mark><br>
<em>Strictly separate build and run stages.</em><br>
We should use release management tools like <code>Jenkins</code> to create pipelines to separate the <strong>build</strong> (building executable by compiling source code), <strong>release</strong> (executable with configuration) and <strong>run</strong> (deployment of release to specific environment) stages.<br>
Release should have a unique id such as timestamp or version like v1.0.0 which can not be mutated. Any change must be a new release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Processes</strong></mark><br>
<em>Execute the app as one or more stateless processes.</em><br>
Microservice we build, should be stateless and should not rely on in-memory cache or filesystem to store data since it usually wiped out on restart. Any data that need to be persist must be stored in backing service like database. However distributed cache like <code>memcache</code>, <code>ehcache</code> or <code>Redis</code> can be used.<br>
We should also never use and rely on &ldquo;sticky sessions&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Port Binding</strong></mark><br>
<em>Export services via port binding.</em><br>
We should always create a standalone microservice using <code>spring boot</code> which is having embedded <code>Tomcat</code> or <code>Jetty</code> webserver. As soon as service starts, it is ready to serve over HTTP by binding to a port. We should not rely on creating a war and then deploying to webserver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Concurrency</strong></mark><br>
<em>Scale out via the process model.</em><br>
Each microservice in application should be able to handle more load by scaling out (deploying multiple copies on microservice behind load balancer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Disposability</strong></mark><br>
<em>Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown</em><br>
We should try to minimize the startup time of microservice and handle the shutdown gracefully. Microservice should be able to start and stop at moment&rsquo;s notice to facilitate fast elastic scaling, rapid deployment of code or config changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Dev/Prod parity</strong></mark><br>
<em>Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible.</em><br>
We should adapt CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuos Delivery) by combining DevOps automation tools like <code>Jenkins</code> to build pipelines, <code>Docker</code> to containerize build with all dependencies, <code>Chef</code> and <code>Puppet</code> to automate delivery process. CI/CD process minimize the gap between development, testing, staging and production environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Logs</strong></mark><br>
<em>Treat logs as event streams</em><br>
Microservice should not manage log files itself, instead treat it as event stream and route it to a centralized log indexing and analysis system such as <code>Splunk</code> or <code>ELK (Elastic logstash Kibana)</code> or data warehousing system such as <code>Hadoop/Hive</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><mark><strong>Admin processes</strong></mark><br>
<em>Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes</em><br>
All admin/management tasks for a microservice like database migration should be deployed and run separately.</p>
</li>
</ol>
